<h2 class="nobreak">THE HAUNTED DOLL&#8217;S HOUSE.</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I&nbsp; SUPPOSE you get stuff of that kind
through your hands pretty often?&#8221;
said Mr Dillet, as he pointed with his stick
to an object which shall be described when
the time comes: and when he said it, he
lied in his throat, and knew that he lied.
Not once in twenty years&mdash;perhaps not
once in a lifetime&mdash;could Mr Chittenden,
skilled as he was in ferreting out the forgotten
treasures of half-a-dozen counties,
expect to handle such a specimen. It was
collectors&#8217; palaver, and Mr Chittenden
recognised it as such.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff of that kind, Mr Dillet! It&#8217;s a
museum piece, that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose there are museums
that&#8217;ll take anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen one, not as good as that, years
back,&#8221; said Mr Chittenden, thoughtfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
&#8220;But that&#8217;s not likely to come into the
market: and I&#8217;m told they &#8217;ave some fine
ones of the period over the water. No:
I&#8217;m only telling you the truth, Mr Dillet,
when I say that if you was to place an
unlimited order with me for the very best
that could be got&mdash;and you know I &#8217;ave
facilities for getting to know of such things,
and a reputation to maintain&mdash;well, all I
can say is, I should lead you straight up
to that one and say, &#8216;I can&#8217;t do no better
for you than that, Sir.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear, hear!&#8221; said Mr Dillet, applauding
ironically with the end of his stick on the
floor of the shop. &#8220;How much are you
sticking the innocent American buyer for
it, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shan&#8217;t be over hard on the buyer,
American or otherwise. You see, it stands
this way, Mr Dillet&mdash;if I knew just a bit
more about the pedigree&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or just a bit less,&#8221; Mr Dillet put in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! you will have your joke, Sir.
No, but as I was saying, if I knew just a
little more than what I do about the piece&mdash;though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
anyone can see for themselves
it&#8217;s a genuine thing, every last corner of
it, and there&#8217;s not been one of my men
allowed to so much as touch it since it
came into the shop&mdash;there&#8217;d be another
figure in the price I&#8217;m asking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s that: five and twenty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Multiply that by three and you&#8217;ve got
it, Sir. Seventy-five&#8217;s my price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And fifty&#8217;s mine,&#8221; said Mr Dillet.</p>

<p>The point of agreement was, of course,
somewhere between the two, it does not
matter exactly where&mdash;I think sixty guineas.
But half-an-hour later the object was being
packed, and within an hour Mr Dillet had
called for it in his car and driven away.
Mr Chittenden, holding the cheque in his
hand, saw him off from the door with smiles,
and returned, still smiling, into the parlour
where his wife was making the tea. He
stopped at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God for that!&#8221; said Mrs Chittenden,
putting down the teapot. &#8220;Mr Dillet,
was it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;Yes, it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d sooner it was him than
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know, he ain&#8217;t a bad feller,
my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May be not, but in my opinion he&#8217;d be
none the worse for a bit of a shake up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if that&#8217;s your opinion, it&#8217;s my
opinion he&#8217;s put himself into the way of
getting one. Anyhow, we shan&#8217;t have no
more of it, and that&#8217;s something to be
thankful for.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Mr and Mrs Chittenden sat down
to tea.</p>

<p>And what of Mr Dillet and of his new
acquisition? What it was, the title of this
story will have told you. What it was like,
I shall have to indicate as well as I can.</p>

<p>There was only just room enough for it
in the car, and Mr Dillet had to sit with
the driver: he had also to go slow, for
though the rooms of the Doll&#8217;s House had
all been stuffed carefully with soft cotton-wool,
jolting was to be avoided, in view of
the immense number of small objects which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
thronged them; and the ten-mile drive was
an anxious time for him, in spite of all the
precautions he insisted upon. At last his
front door was reached, and Collins, the
butler, came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Collins, you must help me
with this thing&mdash;it&#8217;s a delicate job. We
must get it out upright, see? It&#8217;s full of
little things that mustn&#8217;t be displaced more
than we can help. Let&#8217;s see, where shall
we have it? (After a pause for consideration).
Really, I think I shall have to put
it in my own room, to begin with at any
rate. On the big table&mdash;that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was conveyed&mdash;with much talking&mdash;to
Mr Dillet&#8217;s spacious room on the first
floor, looking out on the drive. The sheeting
was unwound from it, and the front
thrown open, and for the next hour or two
Mr Dillet was fully occupied in extracting
the padding and setting in order the contents
of the rooms.</p>

<p>When this thoroughly congenial task was
finished, I must say that it would have been
difficult to find a more perfect and attractive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
specimen of a Doll&#8217;s House in Strawberry
Hill Gothic than that which now stood on
Mr Dillet&#8217;s large kneehole table, lighted up
by the evening sun which came slanting
through three tall sash-windows.</p>

<p>It was quite six feet long, including the
Chapel or Oratory which flanked the front
on the left as you faced it, and the stable
on the right. The main block of the house
was, as I have said, in the Gothic manner:
that is to say, the windows had pointed
arches and were surmounted by what are
called ogival hoods, with crockets and finials
such as we see on the canopies of tombs
built into church walls. At the angles were
absurd turrets covered with arched panels.
The Chapel had pinnacles and buttresses,
and a bell in the turret and coloured glass in
the windows. When the front of the house
was open you saw four large rooms, bedroom,
dining-room, drawing-room and kitchen,
each with its appropriate furniture in a very
complete state.</p>

<p>The stable on the right was in two storeys,
with its proper complement of horses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
coaches and grooms, and with its clock and
Gothic cupola for the clock bell.</p>

<p>Pages, of course, might be written on the
outfit of the mansion&mdash;how many frying
pans, how many gilt chairs, what pictures,
carpets, chandeliers, four-posters, table
linen, glass, crockery and plate it possessed;
but all this must be left to the imagination.
I will only say that the base or plinth on
which the house stood (for it was fitted
with one of some depth which allowed of
a flight of steps to the front door and a
terrace, partly balustraded) contained a
shallow drawer or drawers in which were
neatly stored sets of embroidered curtains,
changes of raiment for the inmates, and,
in short, all the materials for an infinite
series of variations and refittings of the
most absorbing and delightful kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quintessence of Horace Walpole, that&#8217;s
what it is: he must have had something
to do with the making of it.&#8221; Such was
Mr Dillet&#8217;s murmured reflection as he knelt
before it in a reverent ecstasy. &#8220;Simply
wonderful; this is my day and no mistake.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Five hundred pound coming in this morning
for that cabinet which I never cared
about, and now this tumbling into my
hands for a tenth, at the very most, of what
it would fetch in town. Well, well! It
almost makes one afraid something&#8217;ll happen
to counter it. Let&#8217;s have a look at
the population, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly, he set them before him in
a row. Again, here is an opportunity,
which some would snatch at, of making
an inventory of costume: I am incapable
of it.</p>

<p>There were a gentleman and lady, in
blue satin and brocade respectively. There
were two children, a boy and a girl. There
was a cook, a nurse, a footman, and there
were the stable servants, two postillions,
a coachman, two grooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyone else? Yes, possibly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curtains of the four-poster in the
bedroom were closely drawn round four
sides of it, and he put his finger in between
them and felt in the bed. He drew the
finger back hastily, for it almost seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
to him as if something had&mdash;not stirred,
perhaps, but yielded&mdash;in an odd live way
as he pressed it. Then he put back the
curtains, which ran on rods in the proper
manner, and extracted from the bed a white-haired
old gentleman in a long linen night-dress
and cap, and laid him down by the
rest. The tale was complete.</p>

<p>Dinner time was now near, so Mr Dillet
spent but five minutes in putting the lady
and children into the drawing-room, the
gentleman into the dining-room, the servants
into the kitchen and stables, and the
old man back into his bed. He retired
into his dressing room next door, and we
see and hear no more of him until something
like eleven o&#8217;clock at night.</p>

<p>His whim was to sleep surrounded by
some of the gems of his collection. The
big room in which we have seen him contained
his bed: bath, wardrobe, and all the
appliances of dressing were in a commodious
room adjoining: but his four-poster, which
itself was a valued treasure, stood in the
large room where he sometimes wrote, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
often sat, and even received visitors. To-night
he repaired to it in a highly complacent
frame of mind.</p>

<p>There was no striking clock within earshot&mdash;none
on the staircase, none in the
stable, none in the distant Church tower.
Yet it is indubitable that Mr Dillet was
startled out of a very pleasant slumber by
a bell tolling One.</p>

<p>He was so much startled that he did
not merely lie breathless with wide-open
eyes, but actually sat up in his bed.</p>

<p>He never asked himself, till the morning
hours, how it was that, though there was
no light at all in the room, the Doll&#8217;s
House on the kneehole table stood out with
complete clearness. But it was so. The
effect was that of a bright harvest moon
shining full on the front of a big white
stone mansion&mdash;a quarter of a mile away
it might be, and yet every detail was photographically
sharp. There were trees about
it, too&mdash;trees rising behind the chapel and
the house. He seemed to be conscious of
the scent of a cool still September night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
He thought he could hear an occasional
stamp and clink from the stables, as of
horses stirring. And with another shock he
realized that, above the house, he was looking,
not at the wall of his room with its
pictures, but into the profound blue of a
night sky.</p>

<p>There were lights, more than one, in the
windows, and he quickly saw that this was
no four-roomed house with a movable front,
but one of many rooms, and staircases&mdash;a
real house, but seen as if through the wrong
end of a telescope. &#8220;You mean to show
me something,&#8221; he muttered to himself, and
he gazed earnestly on the lighted windows.
They would in real life have been shuttered
or curtained, no doubt, he thought; but, as
it was, there was nothing to intercept his
view of what was being transacted inside
the rooms.</p>

<p>Two rooms were lighted&mdash;one on the
ground floor to the right of the door, one
upstairs, on the left&mdash;the first brightly
enough, the other rather dimly. The lower
room was the dining-room: a table was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
laid, but the meal was over, and only wine
and glasses were left on the table. The
man of the blue satin and the woman of
the brocade were alone in the room, and
they were talking very earnestly, seated
close together at the table, their elbows on
it: every now and again stopping to listen,
as it seemed. Once <i>he</i> rose, came to the
window and opened it and put his head
out and his hand to his ear. There was
a lighted taper in a silver candlestick on a
sideboard. When the man left the window
he seemed to leave the room also; and the
lady, taper in hand, remained standing and
listening. The expression on her face was
that of one striving her utmost to keep
down a fear that threatened to master
her&mdash;and succeeding. It was a hateful face,
too; broad, flat and sly. Now the man
came back and she took some small thing
from him and hurried out of the room.
He, too, disappeared, but only for a moment
or two. The front door slowly opened and
he stepped out and stood on the top of the
<i>perron</i>, looking this way and that; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
turned towards the upper window that was
lighted, and shook his fist.</p>

<p>It was time to look at that upper window.
Through it was seen a four-post bed: a
nurse or other servant in an armchair,
evidently sound asleep; in the bed an old
man lying: awake, and, one would say,
anxious, from the way in which he shifted
about and moved his fingers, beating tunes
on the coverlet. Beyond the bed a door
opened. Light was seen on the ceiling,
and the lady came in: she set down her
candle on a table, came to the fireside and
roused the nurse. In her hand she had an
old-fashioned wine bottle, ready uncorked.
The nurse took it, poured some of the contents
into a little silver sauce-pan, added
some spice and sugar from casters on the
table, and set it to warm on the fire.
Meanwhile the old man in the bed beckoned
feebly to the lady, who came to him, smiling,
took his wrist as if to feel his pulse,
and bit her lip as if in consternation. He
looked at her anxiously, and then pointed
to the window, and spoke. She nodded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and did as the man below had done; opened
the casement and listened&mdash;perhaps rather
ostentatiously: then drew in her head and
shook it, looking at the old man, who
seemed to sigh.</p>

<p>By this time the posset on the fire was
steaming, and the nurse poured it into a
small two-handled silver bowl and brought
it to the bedside. The old man seemed
disinclined for it and was waving it away,
but the lady and the nurse together bent
over him and evidently pressed it upon him.
He must have yielded, for they supported
him into a sitting position, and put it to
his lips. He drank most of it, in several
draughts, and they laid him down. The
lady left the room, smiling good-night to
him, and took the bowl, the bottle and the
silver sauce-pan with her. The nurse returned
to the chair, and there was an
interval of complete quiet.</p>

<p>Suddenly the old man started up in his
bed&mdash;and he must have uttered some cry,
for the nurse started out of her chair and
made but one step of it to the bedside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
He was a sad and terrible sight&mdash;flushed
in the face, almost to blackness, the eyes
glaring whitely, both hands clutching at
his heart, foam at his lips.</p>

<p>For a moment the nurse left him, ran
to the door, flung it wide open, and, one
supposes, screamed aloud for help, then
darted back to the bed and seemed to try
feverishly to soothe him&mdash;to lay him down&mdash;anything.
But as the lady, her husband,
and several servants, rushed into the room
with horrified faces, the old man collapsed
under the nurse&#8217;s hands and lay back, and
the features, contorted with agony and rage,
relaxed slowly into calm.</p>

<p>A few moments later, lights showed out
to the left of the house, and a coach with
flambeaux drove up to the door. A white-wigged
man in black got nimbly out and
ran up the steps, carrying a small leather
trunk-shaped box. He was met in the
doorway by the man and his wife, she
with her handkerchief clutched between her
hands, he with a tragic face, but retaining
his self-control. They led the newcomer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
into the dining-room, where he set his box
of papers on the table, and, turning to them,
listened with a face of consternation at what
they had to tell. He nodded his head again
and again, threw out his hands slightly,
declined, it seemed, offers of refreshment
and lodging for the night, and within a
few minutes came slowly down the steps
entering the coach and driving off the way
he had come. As the man in blue watched
him from the top of the steps, a smile not
pleasant to see stole slowly over his fat
white face. Darkness fell over the whole
scene as the lights of the coach disappeared.</p>

<p>But Mr Dillet remained sitting up in
the bed: he had rightly guessed that there
would be a sequel. The house front glimmered
out again before long. But now
there was a difference. The lights were
in other windows, one at the top of the
house, the other illuminating the range of
coloured windows of the chapel. How he
saw through these is not quite obvious, but
he did. The interior was as carefully furnished
as the rest of the establishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
with its minute red cushions on the desks,
its Gothic stall-canopies, and its western
gallery and pinnacled organ with gold pipes.
On the centre of the black and white pavement
was a bier: four tall candles burned
at the corners. On the bier was a coffin
covered with a pall of black velvet.</p>

<p>As he looked the folds of the pall stirred.
It seemed to rise at one end: it slid downwards:
it fell away, exposing the black
coffin with its silver handles and name-plate.
One of the tall candlesticks swayed and
toppled over. Ask no more, but turn, as
Mr Dillet hastily did, and look in at the
lighted window at the top of the house,
where a boy and girl lay in two truckle-beds,
and a four-poster for the nurse rose
above them. The nurse was not visible for
the moment; but the father and mother
were there, dressed now in mourning, but
with very little sign of mourning in their
demeanour. Indeed, they were laughing
and talking with a good deal of animation,
sometimes to each other, and sometimes
throwing a remark to one or other of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
children, and again laughing at the answers.
Then the father was seen to go on tiptoe
out of the room, taking with him as he
went a white garment that hung on a peg
near the door. He shut the door after him.
A minute or two later it was slowly opened
again, and a muffled head poked round it.
A bent form of sinister shape stepped across
to the truckle-beds, and suddenly stopped,
threw up its arms and revealed, of course,
the father, laughing. The children were
in agonies of terror, the boy with the bed
clothes over his head, the girl throwing
herself out of bed into her mother&#8217;s arms.
Attempts at consolation followed&mdash;the
parents took the children on their laps,
patted them, picked up the white gown
and showed there was no harm in it, and
so forth; and at last putting the children
back into bed, left the room with encouraging
waves of the hand. As they left it,
the nurse came in, and soon the light died
down.</p>

<p>Still Mr Dillet watched immovable.</p>

<p>A new sort of light&mdash;not of lamp or candle&mdash;a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
pale ugly light, began to dawn around
the door-case at the back of the room. The
door was opening again. The seer does not
like to dwell upon what he saw entering
the room: he says it might be described
as a frog&mdash;the size of a man&mdash;but it had
scanty white hair about its head. It was
busy about the truckle-beds, but not for
long. The sound of cries&mdash;faint, as if
coming out of a vast distance&mdash;but, even
so, infinitely appalling, reached the ear.</p>

<p>There were signs of a hideous commotion
all over the house: lights passed along and
up, and doors opened and shut, and running
figures passed within the windows. The
clock in the stable turret tolled one, and
darkness fell again.</p>

<p>It was only dispelled once more, to show
the house front. At the bottom of the
steps dark figures were drawn up in two
lines, holding flaming torches. More dark
figures came down the steps, bearing, first
one, then another small coffin. And the lines
of torch-bearers with the coffins between
them moved silently onward to the left.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>The hours of night passed on&mdash;never so
slowly, Mr Dillet thought. Gradually he
sank down from sitting to lying in his bed&mdash;but
he did not close an eye: and early
next morning he sent for the doctor.</p>

<p>The doctor found him in a disquieting
state of nerves, and recommended sea-air.
To a quiet place on the East Coast he
accordingly repaired by easy stages in his
car.</p>

<p>One of the first people he met on the
sea-front was Mr Chittenden, who, it
appeared, had likewise been advised to
take his wife away for a bit of a change.</p>

<p>Mr Chittenden looked somewhat askance
upon him when they met: and not without
cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t wonder at you being
a bit upset, Mr Dillet. What? yes, well,
I might say &#8217;orrible upset, to be sure,
seeing what me and my poor wife went
through ourselves. But I put it to you,
Mr Dillet, one of two things: was I going
to scrap a lovely piece like that on the one
&#8217;and, or was I going to tell customers: &#8216;I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
selling you a regular picture-palace-dramar
in reel life of the olden time, billed to perform
regular at one o&#8217;clock a.m.&#8217;? Why,
what would you &#8217;ave said yourself? And
next thing you know, two Justices of the
Peace in the back parlour, and pore Mr
and Mrs Chittenden off in a spring cart
to the County Asylum and everyone in
the street saying, &#8216;Ah, I thought it &#8217;ud
come to that. Look at the way the man
drank!&#8217;&mdash;and me next door, or next door
but one, to a total abstainer, as you know.
Well, there was my position. What? Me
&#8217;ave it back in the shop? Well, what do
<i>you</i> think? No, but I&#8217;ll tell you what I
will do. You shall have your money back,
bar the ten pound I paid for it, and you
make what you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later in the day, in what is offensively
called the &#8220;smoke-room&#8221; of the hotel, a
murmured conversation between the two
went on for some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you really know about
that thing, and where it came from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Honest, Mr Dillet, I don&#8217;t know the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
&#8217;ouse. Of course, it came out of the lumber
room of a country &#8217;ouse&mdash;that anyone could
guess. But I&#8217;ll go as far as say this, that I
believe it&#8217;s not a hundred miles from this
place. Which direction and how far I&#8217;ve
no notion. I&#8217;m only judging by guess-work.
The man as I actually paid the cheque to
ain&#8217;t one of my regular men, and I&#8217;ve lost
sight of him; but I &#8217;ave the idea that this
part of the country was his beat, and that&#8217;s
every word I can tell you. But now, Mr
Dillet, there&#8217;s one thing that rather physicks
me&mdash;that old chap,&mdash;I suppose you saw him
drive up to the door&mdash;I thought so: now,
would he have been the medical man, do
you take it? My wife would have it so,
but I stuck to it that was the lawyer, because
he had papers with him, and one he took
out was folded up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree,&#8221; said Mr Dillet. &#8220;Thinking it
over, I came to the conclusion that was
the old man&#8217;s will, ready to be signed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I thought,&#8221; said Mr Chittenden,
&#8220;and I took it that will would have
cut out the young people, eh? Well, well!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
It&#8217;s been a lesson to me, I know that. I
shan&#8217;t buy no more dolls&#8217; houses, nor waste
no more money on the pictures&mdash;and as to
this business of poisonin&#8217; grandpa, well, if I
know myself, I never &#8217;ad much of a turn
for that. Live and let live: that&#8217;s bin my
motto throughout life, and I ain&#8217;t found it
a bad one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Filled with these elevated sentiments, Mr
Chittenden retired to his lodgings. Mr
Dillet next day repaired to the local Institute,
where he hoped to find some clue to
the riddle that absorbed him. He gazed in
despair at a long file of the Canterbury and
York Society&#8217;s publications of the Parish
Registers of the district. No print resembling
the house of his nightmare was
among those that hung on the staircase and
in the passages. Disconsolate, he found
himself at last in a derelict room, staring at
a dusty model of a church in a dusty glass
case: <i>Model of St Stephen&#8217;s Church, Coxham.
Presented by J. Merewether, Esq., of Ilbridge
House, 1877. The work of his ancestor
James Merewether, d. 1786.</i> There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
something in the fashion of it that reminded
him dimly of his horror. He
retraced his steps to a wall map he had
noticed, and made out that Ilbridge House
was in Coxham Parish. Coxham was, as it
happened, one of the parishes of which he
had retained the name when he glanced over
the file of printed registers, and it was not
long before he found in them the record of
the burial of Roger Milford, aged 76, on
the 11th of September, 1757, and of Roger
and Elizabeth Merewether, aged 9 and 7,
on the 19th of the same month. It seemed
worth while to follow up this clue, frail as
it was; and in the afternoon he drove out
to Coxham. The east end of the north aisle
of the church is a Milford chapel, and on
its north wall are tablets to the same
persons; Roger, the elder, it seems, was
distinguished by all the qualities which
adorn &#8220;the Father, the Magistrate, and the
Man&#8221;: the memorial was erected by his
attached daughter Elizabeth, &#8220;who did not
long survive the loss of a parent ever solicitous
for her welfare, and of two amiable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
children.&#8221; The last sentence was plainly
an addition to the original inscription.</p>

<p>A yet later slab told of James Merewether,
husband of Elizabeth, &#8220;who in the dawn of
life practised, not without success, those arts
which, had he continued their exercise, might
in the opinion of the most competent judges
have earned for him the name of the British
Vitruvius: but who, overwhelmed by the
visitation which deprived him of an affectionate
partner and a blooming offspring,
passed his Prime and Age in a secluded yet
elegant Retirement: his grateful Nephew
and Heir indulges a pious sorrow by this
too brief recital of his excellences.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children were more simply commemorated.
Both died on the night of the
12th of September.</p>

<p>Mr Dillet felt sure that in Ilbridge House
he had found the scene of his drama. In
some old sketch-book, possibly in some old
print, he may yet find convincing evidence
that he is right. But the Ilbridge House
of to-day is not that which he sought; it is
an Elizabethan erection of the forties, in red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
brick with stone quoins and dressings. A
quarter of a mile from it, in a low part of
the park, backed by ancient, stag-horned,
ivy-strangled trees and thick undergrowth,
are marks of a terraced platform overgrown
with rough grass. A few stone balusters lie
here and there, and a heap or two, covered
with nettles and ivy, of wrought stones with
badly carved crockets. This, someone told
Mr Dillet, was the site of an older house.</p>

<p>As he drove out of the village, the hall
clock struck four, and Mr Dillet started up
and clapped his hands to his ears. It was
not the first time he had heard that bell.</p>

<p>Awaiting an offer from the other side of
the Atlantic, the doll&#8217;s house still reposes,
carefully sheeted, in a loft over Mr Dillet&#8217;s
stables, whither Collins conveyed it on the
day when Mr Dillet started for the sea coast.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">MR DAVIDSON was spending the
first week in January alone in a
country town. A combination of circumstances
had driven him to that drastic
course: his nearest relations were enjoying
winter sports abroad, and the friends who
had been kindly anxious to replace them
had an infectious complaint in the house.
Doubtless he might have found someone
else to take pity on him. &#8220;But,&#8221; he reflected,
&#8220;most of them have made up their
parties, and, after all, it is only for three
or four days at most that I have to fend
for myself, and it will be just as well if I
can get a move on with my introduction
to the Leventhorp Papers. I might use
the time by going down as near as I can
to Gaulsford and making acquaintance with<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the neighbourhood. I ought to see the
remains of Leventhorp House, and the
tombs in the church.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first day after his arrival at the
Swan Hotel at Longbridge was so stormy
that he got no farther than the tobacconist&#8217;s.
The next, comparatively bright, he used
for his visit to Gaulsford, which interested
him more than a little, but had no ulterior
consequences. The third, which was really
a pearl of a day for early January, was too
fine to be spent indoors. He gathered from
the landlord that a favourite practice of
visitors in the summer was to take a morning
train to a couple of stations westward,
and walk back down the valley of the Tent,
through Stanford St Thomas and Stanford
Magdalene, both of which were accounted
highly picturesque villages. He closed with
this plan, and we now find him seated in
a third-class carriage at 9.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, on his
way to Kingsbourne Junction, and studying
the map of the district.</p>

<p>One old man was his only fellow-traveller,
a piping old man, who seemed inclined for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
conversation. So Mr Davidson, after going
through the necessary versicles and responses
about the weather, inquired whether
he was going far.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, not far, not this morning, sir,&#8221;
said the old man. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t only goin&#8217; so
far as what they call Kingsbourne Junction.
There isn&#8217;t but two stations betwixt here
and there. Yes, they calls it Kingsbourne
Junction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going there, too,&#8221; said Mr Davidson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed, sir; do you know that part?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m only going for the sake of
taking a walk back to Longbridge, and
seeing a bit of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed, sir! Well, &#8217;tis a beautiful
day for a gentleman as enjoys a bit of a
walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to be sure. Have you got far
to go when you get to Kingsbourne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I ain&#8217;t got far to go, once I
get to Kingsbourne Junction. I&#8217;m agoin&#8217;
to see my daughter, sir. She live at
Brockstone. That&#8217;s about two mile across
the fields from what they call Kingsbourne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Junction, that is. You&#8217;ve got that marked
down on your map, I expect, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect I have. Let me see, Brockstone,
did you say? Here&#8217;s Kingsbourne,
yes; and which way is Brockstone&mdash;toward
the Stanfords? Ah, I see it: Brockstone
Court, in a park. I don&#8217;t see the village,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, you wouldn&#8217;t see no village of
Brockstone. There ain&#8217;t only the Court
and the Chapel at Brockstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chapel? Oh, yes, that&#8217;s marked here,
too. The Chapel; close by the Court, it
seems to be. Does it belong to the Court?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, that&#8217;s close up to the Court,
only a step. Yes, that belong to the
Court. My daughter, you see, sir, she&#8217;s
the keeper&#8217;s wife now, and she live at the
Court and look after things now the
family&#8217;s away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one living there now, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, not for a number of years.
The old gentleman, he lived there when I
was a lad; and the lady, she lived on after
him to very near upon ninety years of age.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
And then she died, and them that have
it now, they&#8217;ve got this other place, in
Warwickshire I believe it is, and they
don&#8217;t do nothin&#8217; about lettin&#8217; the Court
out; but Colonel Wildman, he have the
shooting, and young Mr Clark, he&#8217;s the
agent, he come over once in so many weeks
to see to things, and my daughter&#8217;s husband,
he&#8217;s the keeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who uses the Chapel? just the
people round about, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no one don&#8217;t use the Chapel.
Why, there ain&#8217;t no one to go. All the
people about, they go to Stanford St
Thomas Church; but my son-in-law, he
go to Kingsbourne Church now, because
the gentleman at Stanford, he have this
Gregory singin&#8217;, and my son-in-law, he
don&#8217;t like that; he say he can hear the
old donkey brayin&#8217; any day of the week,
and he like something a little cheerful on
the Sunday.&#8221; The old man drew his hand
across his mouth and laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what my son-in-law say; he say he can
hear the old donkey,&#8221; etc., <i>da capo</i>.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Mr Davidson also laughed as honestly as
he could, thinking meanwhile that Brockstone
Court and Chapel would probably
be worth including in his walk; for the
map showed that from Brockstone he could
strike the Tent Valley quite as easily
as by following the main Kingsbourne-Longbridge
road. So, when the mirth
excited by the remembrance of the son-in-law&#8217;s
<i>bon mot</i> had died down, he returned
to the charge, and ascertained that both
the Court and the Chapel were of the class
known as &#8220;old-fashioned places,&#8221; and that
the old man would be very willing to
take him thither, and his daughter would
be happy to show him whatever she
could.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that ain&#8217;t a lot, sir, not as if the
family was livin&#8217; there; all the lookin&#8217;-glasses
is covered up, and the paintin&#8217;s,
and the curtains and carpets folded away;
not but what I dare say she could show
you a pair just to look at, because she go
over them to see as the morth shouldn&#8217;t
get into &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t mind about that, thank you;
if she can show me the inside of the Chapel,
that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like best to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she can show you that right enough,
sir. She have the key of the door, you see,
and most weeks she go in and dust about.
That&#8217;s a nice Chapel, that is. My son-in-law,
he say he&#8217;ll be bound they didn&#8217;t have
none of this Gregory singin&#8217; there. Dear!
I can&#8217;t help but smile when I think of him
sayin&#8217; that about th&#8217; old donkey. &#8216;I can hear
him bray,&#8217; he say, &#8216;any day of the week&#8217;;
and so he can, sir; that&#8217;s true, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>The walk across the fields from Kingsbourne
to Brockstone was very pleasant.
It lay for the most part on the top of the
country, and commanded wide views over
a succession of ridges, plough and pasture,
or covered with dark-blue woods&mdash;all ending,
more or less abruptly, on the right, in
headlands that overlooked the wide valley
of a great western river. The last field
they crossed was bounded by a close copse,
and no sooner were they in it than the
path turned downward very sharply, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
became evident that Brockstone was neatly
fitted into a sudden and very narrow valley.
It was not long before they had glimpses of
groups of smokeless stone chimneys, and
stone-tiled roofs, close beneath their feet;
and, not many minutes after that, they
were wiping their shoes at the back door
of Brockstone Court, while the keeper&#8217;s dogs
barked very loudly in unseen places, and
Mrs Porter, in quick succession, screamed
at them to be quiet, greeted her father, and
begged both her visitors to step in.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that Mr
Davidson should escape being taken through
the principal rooms of the Court, in spite
of the fact that the house was entirely out
of commission. Pictures, carpets, curtains,
furniture, were all covered up or put away,
as old Mr Avery had said; and the admiration
which our friend was very ready to
bestow had to be lavished on the proportions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
of the rooms, and on the one
painted ceiling, upon which an artist who
had fled from London in the plague-year
had depicted the Triumph of Loyalty and
Defeat of Sedition. In this Mr Davidson
could show an unfeigned interest. The
portraits of Cromwell, Ireton, Bradshaw,
Peters, and the rest, writhing in carefully
devised torments, were evidently the part
of the design to which most pains had been
devoted.</p>

<p>&#8220;That were the old Lady Sadleir had
that paintin&#8217; done, same as the one what
put up the Chapel. They say she were the
first that went up to London to dance on
Oliver Cromwell&#8217;s grave.&#8221; So said Mr
Avery, and continued musingly, &#8220;Well, I
suppose she got some satisfaction to her
mind, but I don&#8217;t know as I should want
to pay the fare to London and back just
for that; and my son-in-law, he say the
same; he say he don&#8217;t know as he should
have cared to pay all that money only for
that. I was tellin&#8217; the gentleman as we
came along in the train, Mary, what your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
&#8217;Arry says about this Gregory singin&#8217; down
at Stanford here. We &#8217;ad a bit of a laugh
over that, sir, didn&#8217;t us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to be sure we did; ha! ha!&#8221; Once
again Mr Davidson strove to do justice to
the pleasantry of the keeper. &#8220;But,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;if Mrs Porter can show me the
Chapel, I think it should be now, for the
days aren&#8217;t long, and I want to get back to
Longbridge before it falls quite dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even if Brockstone Court has not been
illustrated in <i>Rural Life</i> (and I think it
has not), I do not propose to point out its
excellences here; but of the Chapel a word
must be said. It stands about a hundred
yards from the house, and has its own little
graveyard and trees about it. It is a stone
building about seventy feet long, and in the
Gothic style, as that style was understood
in the middle of the seventeenth century.
On the whole it resembles some of the
Oxford college chapels as much as anything,
save that it has a distinct chancel, like a
parish church, and a fanciful domed bell-turret
at the south-west angle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>When the west door was thrown open,
Mr Davidson could not repress an exclamation
of pleased surprise at the completeness
and richness of the interior. Screen-work,
pulpit, seating, and glass&mdash;all were of the
same period; and as he advanced into the
nave and sighted the organ-case with its
gold-embossed pipes in the western gallery,
his cup of satisfaction was filled. The glass
in the nave windows was chiefly armorial;
and in the chancel were figure-subjects, of
the kind that may be seen at Abbey Dore,
of Lord Scudamore&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>But this is not an arch&aelig;ological review.</p>

<p>While Mr Davidson was still busy examining
the remains of the organ (attributed
to one of the Dallams, I believe), old Mr
Avery had stumped up into the chancel
and was lifting the dust-cloths from the
blue-velvet cushions of the stall-desks. Evidently
it was here that the family sat.</p>

<p>Mr Davidson heard him say in a rather
hushed tone of surprise, &#8220;Why, Mary, here&#8217;s
all the books open agin!&#8221;</p>

<p>The reply was in a voice that sounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
peevish rather than surprised. &#8220;Tt-tt-tt,
well, there, I never!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs Porter went over to where her father
was standing, and they continued talking in
a lower key. Mr Davidson saw plainly that
something not quite in the common run
was under discussion; so he came down
the gallery stairs and joined them. There
was no sign of disorder in the chancel any
more than in the rest of the Chapel, which
was beautifully clean; but the eight folio
Prayer-Books on the cushions of the stall-desks
were indubitably open.</p>

<p>Mrs Porter was inclined to be fretful over
it. &#8220;Whoever can it be as does it?&#8221; she
said: &#8220;for there&#8217;s no key but mine, nor yet
door but the one we came in by, and the
winders is barred, every one of &#8217;em; I don&#8217;t
like it, father, that I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Mrs Porter? Anything
wrong?&#8221; said Mr Davidson.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, nothing reely wrong, only these
books. Every time, pretty near, that I
come in to do up the place, I shuts &#8217;em and
spreads the cloths over &#8217;em to keep off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
dust, ever since Mr Clark spoke about it,
when I first come; and yet there they are
again, and always the same page&mdash;and as I
says, whoever it can be as does it with the
door and winders shut; and as I says, it
makes anyone feel queer comin&#8217; in here
alone, as I &#8217;ave to do, not as I&#8217;m given
that way myself, not to be frightened easy,
I mean to say; and there&#8217;s not a rat in the
place&mdash;not as no rat wouldn&#8217;t trouble to do
a thing like that, do you think, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly, I should say; but it sounds
very queer. Are they always open at the
same place, did you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always the same place, sir, one of the
psalms it is, and I didn&#8217;t particular notice it
the first time or two, till I see a little red
line of printing, and it&#8217;s always caught my
eye since.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr Davidson walked along the stalls and
looked at the open books. Sure enough,
they all stood at the same page; Psalm
cix., and at the head of it, just between
the number and the <i>Deus laudum</i>, was a
rubric, &#8220;For the 25th day of April.&#8221; Without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
pretending to minute knowledge of the
history of the Book of Common Prayer, he
knew enough to be sure that this was a very
odd and wholly unauthorized addition to its
text; and though he remembered that April
25 is St Mark&#8217;s Day, he could not imagine
what appropriateness this very savage psalm
could have to that festival. With slight
misgivings he ventured to turn over the
leaves to examine the title-page, and knowing
the need for particular accuracy in these
matters, he devoted some ten minutes to
making a line-for-line transcript of it. The
date was 1653; the printer called himself
Anthony Cadman. He turned to the list of
proper psalms for certain days; yes, added
to it was that same inexplicable entry:
<i>For the 25th day of April: the 109th Psalm</i>.
An expert would no doubt have thought of
many other points to inquire into, but this
antiquary, as I have said, was no expert.
He took stock, however, of the binding&mdash;a
handsome one of tooled blue leather, bearing
the arms that figured in several of the nave
windows in various combinations.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;How often,&#8221; he said at last to Mrs
Porter, &#8220;have you found these books lying
open like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reely I couldn&#8217;t say, sir, but it&#8217;s a great
many times now. Do you recollect, father,
me telling you about it the first time I
noticed it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I do, my dear; you was in a rare
taking, and I don&#8217;t so much wonder at it;
that was five year ago I was paying you a
visit at Michaelmas time, and you come in
at tea-time, and says you, &#8216;Father, there&#8217;s
the books laying open under the cloths
agin;&#8217; and I didn&#8217;t know what my daughter
was speakin&#8217; about, you see, sir, and I says,
&#8216;Books?&#8217; just like that, I says; and then it
all came out. But as Harry says,&mdash;that&#8217;s
my son-in-law, sir,&mdash;&#8216;whoever it can be,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;as does it, because there ain&#8217;t only the
one door, and we keeps the key locked up,&#8217;
he says, &#8216;and the winders is barred, every
one on &#8217;em. Well,&#8217; he says, &#8216;I lay once I
could catch &#8217;em at it, they wouldn&#8217;t do it a
second time,&#8217; he says. And no more they
wouldn&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t believe, sir. Well, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
was five year ago, and it&#8217;s been happenin&#8217;
constant ever since by your account, my
dear. Young Mr Clark, he don&#8217;t seem to
think much to it; but then he don&#8217;t live
here, you see, and &#8217;tisn&#8217;t his business to
come and clean up here of a dark afternoon,
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you never notice anything
else odd when you are at work here, Mrs
Porter?&#8221; said Mr Davidson.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I do not,&#8221; said Mrs Porter,
&#8220;and it&#8217;s a funny thing to me I don&#8217;t, with
the feeling I have as there&#8217;s someone settin&#8217;
here&mdash;no, it&#8217;s the other side, just within the
screen&mdash;and lookin&#8217; at me all the time I&#8217;m
dustin&#8217; in the gallery and pews. But I never
yet see nothin&#8217; worse than myself, as the
sayin&#8217; goes, and I kindly hope I never may.&#8221;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the conversation that followed (there
was not much of it), nothing was added to
the statement of the case. Having parted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
on good terms with Mr Avery and his
daughter, Mr Davidson addressed himself
to his eight-mile walk. The little valley of
Brockstone soon led him down into the
broader one of the Tent, and on to Stanford
St Thomas, where he found refreshment.</p>

<p>We need not accompany him all the way
to Longbridge. But as he was changing
his socks before dinner, he suddenly paused
and said half-aloud, &#8220;By Jove, that is a rum
thing!&#8221; It had not occurred to him before
how strange it was that any edition of the
Prayer-Book should have been issued in
1653, seven years before the Restoration,
five years before Cromwell&#8217;s death, and
when the use of the book, let alone the
printing of it, was penal. He must have
been a bold man who put his name and a
date on that title-page. Only, Mr Davidson
reflected, it probably was not his name at all,
for the ways of printers in difficult times
were devious.</p>

<p>As he was in the front hall of the Swan
that evening, making some investigations
about trains, a small motor stopped in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
of the door, and out of it came a small man
in a fur coat, who stood on the steps and
gave directions in a rather yapping foreign
accent to his chauffeur. When he came
into the hotel, he was seen to be black-haired
and pale-faced, with a little pointed beard,
and gold <i>pince-nez</i>; altogether, very neatly
turned out.</p>

<p>He went to his room, and Mr Davidson saw
no more of him till dinner-time. As they
were the only two dining that night, it was
not difficult for the newcomer to find an
excuse for falling into talk; he was evidently
wishing to make out what brought
Mr Davidson into that neighbourhood at
that season.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me how far it is from here
to Arlingworth?&#8221; was one of his early
questions; and it was one which threw
some light on his own plans; for Mr Davidson
recollected having seen at the station
an advertisement of a sale at Arlingworth
Hall, comprising old furniture, pictures,
and books. This, then, was a London
dealer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been there.
I believe it lies out by Kingsbourne&mdash;it
can&#8217;t be less than twelve miles. I see
there&#8217;s a sale there shortly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other looked at him inquisitively,
and he laughed. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said, as if
answering a question, &#8220;you needn&#8217;t be
afraid of my competing; I&#8217;m leaving this
place to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>This cleared the air, and the dealer,
whose name was Homberger, admitted that
he was interested in books, and thought
there might be in these old country-house
libraries something to repay a journey.
&#8220;For,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we English have always
this marvellous talent for accumulating
rarities in the most unexpected places,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>And in the course of the evening he was
most interesting on the subject of finds
made by himself and others. &#8220;I shall take
the occasion after this sale to look round
the district a bit; perhaps you could inform
me of some likely spots, Mr Davidson?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Mr Davidson, though he had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
some very tempting locked-up book-cases
at Brockstone Court, kept his counsel. He
did not really like Mr Homberger.</p>

<p>Next day, as he sat in the train, a little
ray of light came to illuminate one of yesterday&#8217;s
puzzles. He happened to take out
an almanac-diary that he had bought for
the new year, and it occurred to him to
look at the remarkable events for April 25.
There it was: &#8220;St Mark. Oliver Cromwell
born, 1599.&#8221;</p>

<p>That, coupled with the painted ceiling,
seemed to explain a good deal. The figure
of old Lady Sadleir became more substantial
to his imagination, as of one in whom
love for Church and King had gradually
given place to intense hate of the power
that had silenced the one and slaughtered
the other. What curious evil service was
that which she and a few like her had been
wont to celebrate year by year in that
remote valley? And how in the world had
she managed to elude authority? And
again, did not this persistent opening of
the books agree oddly with the other traits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
of her portrait known to him? It would
be interesting for anyone who chanced to
be near Brockstone on the twenty-fifth of
April to look in at the Chapel and see if
anything exceptional happened. When he
came to think of it, there seemed to be no
reason why he should not be that person
himself; he, and if possible, some congenial
friend. He resolved that so it should be.</p>

<p>Knowing that he knew really nothing
about the printing of Prayer-Books, he
realized that he must make it his business
to get the best light on the matter without
divulging his reasons. I may say at once
that his search was entirely fruitless. One
writer of the early part of the nineteenth
century, a writer of rather windy and
rhapsodical chat about books, professed to
have heard of a special anti-Cromwellian
issue of the Prayer-Book in the very midst
of the Commonwealth period. But he did
not claim to have seen a copy, and no one
had believed him. Looking into this matter,
Mr Davidson found that the statement was
based on letters from a correspondent who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
had lived near Longbridge; so he was
inclined to think that the Brockstone
Prayer-Books were at the bottom of it,
and had excited a momentary interest.</p>

<p>Months went on, and St Mark&#8217;s Day
came near. Nothing interfered with Mr
Davidson&#8217;s plans of visiting Brockstone, or
with those of the friend whom he had persuaded
to go with him, and to whom alone
he had confided the puzzle. The same
9.45 train which had taken him in January
took them now to Kingsbourne; the same
field-path led them to Brockstone. But
to-day they stopped more than once to
pick a cowslip; the distant woods and
ploughed uplands were of another colour,
and in the copse there was, as Mrs Porter
said, &#8220;a regular charm of birds; why you
couldn&#8217;t hardly collect your mind sometimes
with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She recognized Mr Davidson at once,
and was very ready to do the honours of
the Chapel. The new visitor, Mr Witham,
was as much struck by the completeness
of it as Mr Davidson had been. &#8220;There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
can&#8217;t be such another in England,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Books open again, Mrs Porter?&#8221; said
Davidson, as they walked up to the chancel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, yes, I expect so, sir,&#8221; said Mrs
Porter, as she drew off the cloths. &#8220;Well,
there!&#8221; she exclaimed the next moment,
&#8220;if they ain&#8217;t shut! That&#8217;s the first time
ever I&#8217;ve found &#8217;em so. But it&#8217;s not for
want of care on my part, I do assure you,
gentlemen, if they wasn&#8217;t, for I felt the
cloths the last thing before I shut up last
week, when the gentleman had done photografting
the heast winder, and every one
was shut, and where there was ribbons left,
I tied &#8217;em. Now I think of it, I don&#8217;t
remember ever to &#8217;ave done that before,
and per&#8217;aps, whoever it is, it just made
the difference to &#8217;em. Well, it only shows,
don&#8217;t it? If at first you don&#8217;t succeed, try,
try, try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two men had been examining
the books, and now Davidson
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
something wrong here, Mrs Porter. These
are not the same books.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would make too long a business to
detail all Mrs Porter&#8217;s outcries, and the
questionings that followed. The upshot
was this. Early in January the gentleman
had come to see over the Chapel, and
thought a great deal of it, and said he must
come back in the spring weather and take
some photografts. And only a week ago
he had drove up in his motoring car, and
a very &#8217;eavy box with the slides in it, and
she had locked him in because he said something
about a long explosion, and she was
afraid of some damage happening; and he
says, no, not explosion, but it appeared the
lantern what they take the slides with
worked very slow; and so he was in there
the best part of an hour and she come and
let him out, and he drove off with his box
and all and gave her his visiting-card, and
oh, dear, dear, to think of such a thing!
he must have changed the books and took
the old ones away with him in his box.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of man was he?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>&#8220;Oh, dear, he was a small-made gentleman,
if you can call him so after the way
he&#8217;ve behaved, with black hair, that is if
it was hair, and gold eye-glasses, if they
was gold; reely, one don&#8217;t know what to
believe. Sometimes I doubt he weren&#8217;t a
reel Englishman at all, and yet he seemed
to know the language, and had the name on
his visiting-card like anybody else might.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so; might we see the card? Yes;
T. W. Henderson, and an address somewhere
near Bristol. Well, Mrs Porter, it&#8217;s
quite plain this Mr Henderson, as he calls
himself, has walked off with your eight
Prayer-Books and put eight others about
the same size in place of them. Now listen
to me. I suppose you must tell your husband
about this, but neither you nor he
must say one word about it to anyone else.
If you&#8217;ll give me the address of the agent,&mdash;Mr
Clark, isn&#8217;t it?&mdash;I will write to him
and tell him exactly what has happened,
and that it really is no fault of yours. But,
you understand, we must keep it very quiet;
and why? Because this man who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
stolen the books will of course try to sell
them one at a time&mdash;for I may tell you
they are worth a good deal of money&mdash;and
the only way we can bring it home to him
is by keeping a sharp lookout and saying
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>By dint of repeating the same advice in
various forms, they succeeded in impressing
Mrs Porter with the real need for silence,
and were forced to make a concession only
in the case of Mr Avery, who was expected
on a visit shortly. &#8220;But you may be safe
with father, sir,&#8221; said Mrs Porter. &#8220;Father
ain&#8217;t a talkin&#8217; man.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not quite Mr Davidson&#8217;s experience
of him; still, there were no neighbours
at Brockstone, and even Mr Avery
must be aware that gossip with anybody on
such a subject would be likely to end in
the Porters&#8217; having to look out for another
situation.</p>

<p>A last question was whether Mr Henderson,
so-called, had anyone with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, not when he come he hadn&#8217;t;
he was working his own motoring car himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
and what luggage he had, let me see:
there was his lantern and this box of slides
inside the carriage, which I helped him into
the Chapel and out of it myself with it, if
only I&#8217;d knowed! And as he drove away
under the big yew tree by the monument,
I see the long white bundle laying on the
top of the coach, what I didn&#8217;t notice when
he drove up. But he set in front, sir, and
only the boxes inside behind him. And do
you reely think, sir, as his name weren&#8217;t
Henderson at all? Oh, dear me, what a
dreadful thing! Why, fancy what trouble
it might bring to a innocent person that
might never have set foot in the place but
for that!&#8221;</p>

<p>They left Mrs Porter in tears. On the
way home there was much discussion as to
the best means of keeping watch upon
possible sales. What Henderson-Homberger
(for there could be no real doubt
of the identity) had done was, obviously,
to bring down the requisite number of folio
Prayer-Books&mdash;disused copies from college
chapels and the like, bought ostensibly for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the sake of the bindings, which were superficially
like enough to the old ones&mdash;and
to substitute them at his leisure for the
genuine articles. A week had now passed
without any public notice being taken of
the theft. He would take a little time
himself to find out about the rarity of the
books, and would ultimately, no doubt,
&#8220;place&#8221; them cautiously. Between them,
Davidson and Witham were in a position to
know a good deal of what was passing in
the book-world, and they could map out
the ground pretty completely. A weak
point with them at the moment was that
neither of them knew under what other
name or names Henderson-Homberger
carried on business. But there are ways of
solving these problems.</p>

<p>And yet all this planning proved unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>We are transported to a London office on
this same 25th of April. We find there,
within closed doors, late in the day, two
police inspectors, a commissionaire, and a
youthful clerk. The two latter, both rather
pale and shaky in appearance, are sitting on
chairs and being questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long do you say you&#8217;ve been in
this Mr Poschwitz&#8217;s employment? Six
months? And what was his business?
Attended sales in various parts and brought
home parcels of books. Did he keep a shop
anywhere? No? Disposed of &#8217;em here
and there, and sometimes to private collectors.
Right. Now then, when did he
go out last? Rather better than a week
ago? Tell you where he was going? No?
Said he was going to start next day from
his private residence, and shouldn&#8217;t be at
the office&mdash;that&#8217;s here, eh?&mdash;before two days;
you was to attend as usual. Where is his
private residence? Oh, that&#8217;s the address,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
Norwood way; I see. Any family? Not
in this country? Now, then, what account
do you give of what&#8217;s happened since he
came back? Came back on the Tuesday,
did he? and this is the Saturday. Bring
any books? One package; where is it? In
the safe? You got the key? No, to be
sure, it&#8217;s open, of course. How did he seem
when he got back&mdash;cheerful? Well, but
how do you mean&mdash;curious? Thought he
might be in for an illness: he said that, did
he? Odd smell got in his nose, couldn&#8217;t
get rid of it; told you to let him know who
wanted to see him before you let &#8217;em in?
That wasn&#8217;t usual with him? Much the
same all Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
Out a good deal; said he was going to the
British Museum. Often went there to make
inquiries in the way of his business. Walked
up and down a lot in the office when he was
in. Anyone call in on those days? Mostly
when he was out. Anyone find him in?
Oh, Mr Collinson? Who&#8217;s Mr Collinson?
An old customer; know his address? All
right, give it us afterwards. Well, now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
what about this morning? You left Mr
Poschwitz&#8217;s here at twelve and went home.
Anybody see you? Commissionaire, you
did? Remained at home till summoned
here. Very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, commissionaire; we have your
name&mdash;Watkins, eh? Very well, make your
statement; don&#8217;t go too quick, so as we can
get it down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on duty &#8217;ere later than usual, Mr
Potwitch &#8217;aving asked me to remain on, and
ordered his lunching to be sent in, which
came as ordered. I was in the lobby from
eleven-thirty on, and see Mr Bligh [the
clerk] leave at about twelve. After that no
one come in at all except Mr Potwitch&#8217;s
lunching come at one o&#8217;clock and the man
left in five minutes&#8217; time. Towards the
afternoon I became tired of waitin&#8217; and I
come upstairs to this first floor. The outer
door what lead to the orfice stood open, and
I come up to the plate-glass door here. Mr
Potwitch he was standing behind the table
smoking a cigar, and he laid it down on the
mantelpiece and felt in his trouser pockets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
and took out a key and went across to the
safe. And I knocked on the glass, thinkin&#8217;
to see if he wanted me to come and take
away his tray; but he didn&#8217;t take no notice,
bein&#8217; engaged with the safe door. Then he
got it open and stooped down and seemed
to be lifting up a package off of the floor of
the safe. And then, sir, I see what looked
to be like a great roll of old shabby white
flannel, about four to five feet high, fall
for&#8217;ards out of the inside of the safe right
against Mr Potwitch&#8217;s shoulder as he was
stooping over; and Mr Potwitch, he raised
himself up as it were, resting his hands on
the package, and gave a exclamation. And
I can&#8217;t hardly expect you should take what
I says, but as true as I stand here I see this
roll had a kind of a face in the upper end of
it, sir. You can&#8217;t be more surprised than
what I was, I can assure you, and I&#8217;ve seen
a lot in me time. Yes, I can describe it if
you wish it, sir; it was very much the same
as this wall here in colour [the wall had an
earth-coloured distemper] and it had a bit
of a band tied round underneath. And the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
eyes, well they was dry-like, and much as
if there was two big spiders&#8217; bodies in the
holes. Hair? no, I don&#8217;t know as there
was much hair to be seen; the flannel-stuff
was over the top of the &#8217;ead. I&#8217;m very sure
it warn&#8217;t what it should have been. No, I
only see it in a flash, but I took it in like a
photograft&mdash;wish I hadn&#8217;t. Yes, sir, it fell
right over on to Mr Potwitch&#8217;s shoulder, and
this face hid in his neck,&mdash;yes, sir, about
where the injury was,&mdash;more like a ferret
going for a rabbit than anythink else; and
he rolled over, and of course I tried to get
in at the door; but as you know, sir, it were
locked on the inside, and all I could do, I
rung up everyone, and the surgeon come,
and the police and you gentlemen, and you
know as much as what I do. If you won&#8217;t
be requirin&#8217; me any more to-day I&#8217;d be glad
to be getting off home; it&#8217;s shook me up
more than I thought for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said one of the inspectors, when
they were left alone; and &#8220;Well?&#8221; said the
other inspector; and, after a pause, &#8220;What&#8217;s
the surgeon&#8217;s report again? You&#8217;ve got it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
there. Yes. Effect on the blood like the
worst kind of snake-bite; death almost
instantaneous. I&#8217;m glad of that, for his
sake; he was a nasty sight. No case for
detaining this man Watkins, anyway; we
know all about him. And what about this
safe, now? We&#8217;d better go over it again;
and, by the way, we haven&#8217;t opened that
package he was busy with when he died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, handle it careful,&#8221; said the other;
&#8220;there might be this snake in it, for what
you know. Get a light into the corners of
the place, too. Well, there&#8217;s room for a
shortish person to stand up in; but what
about ventilation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said the other slowly, as he
explored the safe with an electric torch,
&#8220;perhaps they didn&#8217;t require much of that.
My word! it strikes warm coming out of
that place! like a vault, it is. But here,
what&#8217;s this bank-like of dust all spread out
into the room? That must have come there
since the door was opened; it would sweep
it all away if you moved it&mdash;see? Now
what do you make of that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Make of it? About as much as I make
of anything else in this case. One of
London&#8217;s mysteries this is going to be, by
what I can see. And I don&#8217;t believe a
photographer&#8217;s box full of large-size old-fashioned
Prayer-Books is going to take
us much further. For that&#8217;s just what
your package is.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a natural but hasty utterance.
The preceding narrative shows that there
was in fact plenty of material for constructing
a case; and when once Messrs Davidson
and Witham had brought their end to
Scotland Yard, the join-up was soon made,
and the circle completed.</p>

<p>To the relief of Mrs Porter, the owners
of Brockstone decided not to replace the
books in the Chapel; they repose, I believe,
in a safe-deposit in town. The police have
their own methods of keeping certain matters
out of the newspapers; otherwise, it can
hardly be supposed that Watkins&#8217;s evidence
about Mr Poschwitz&#8217;s death could have
failed to furnish a good many head-lines
of a startling character to the press.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A NEIGHBOUR&#8217;S LANDMARK</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THOSE who spend the greater part of
their time in reading or writing books
are, of course, apt to take rather particular
notice of accumulations of books when they
come across them. They will not pass a
stall, a shop, or even a bedroom-shelf without
reading some title, and if they find
themselves in an unfamiliar library, no host
need trouble himself further about their
entertainment. The putting of dispersed
sets of volumes together, or the turning
right way up of those which the dusting
housemaid has left in an apoplectic condition,
appeals to them as one of the
lesser Works of Mercy. Happy in these
employments, and in occasionally opening
an eighteenth-century octavo, to see &#8220;what
it is all about,&#8221; and to conclude after five<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
minutes that it deserves the seclusion it now
enjoys, I had reached the middle of a wet
August afternoon at Betton Court&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You begin in a deeply Victorian manner,&#8221;
I said; &#8220;is this to continue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, if you please,&#8221; said my
friend, looking at me over his spectacles,
&#8220;that I am a Victorian by birth and education,
and that the Victorian tree may not
unreasonably be expected to bear Victorian
fruit. Further, remember that an immense
quantity of clever and thoughtful Rubbish
is now being written about the Victorian
age. Now,&#8221; he went on, laying his papers
on his knee, &#8220;that article, &#8216;The Stricken
Years,&#8217; in the <i>Times</i> Literary Supplement
the other day,&mdash;able? of course it is able;
but, oh! my soul and body, do just hand
it over here, will you? it&#8217;s on the table
by you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were to read me something
you had written,&#8221; I said, without
moving, &#8220;but, of course&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Very well,
then, I&#8217;ll do that first. But I <i>should</i> like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
to show you afterwards what I mean.
However&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And he lifted the sheets
of paper and adjusted his spectacles.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;at Betton Court, where, generations
back, two country-house libraries had been
fused together, and no descendant of either
stock had ever faced the task of picking
them over or getting rid of duplicates.
Now I am not setting out to tell of rarities
I may have discovered, of Shakespeare
quartos bound up in volumes of political
tracts, or anything of that kind, but of an
experience which befell me in the course of
my search&mdash;an experience which I cannot
either explain away or fit into the scheme
of my ordinary life.</p>

<p>It was, I said, a wet August afternoon,
rather windy, rather warm. Outside the
window great trees were stirring and weeping.
Between them were stretches of green
and yellow country (for the Court stands
high on a hillside), and blue hills far off,
veiled with rain. Up above was a very
restless and hopeless movement of low
clouds travelling north-west. I had suspended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
my work&mdash;if you call it work&mdash;for
some minutes to stand at the window
and look at these things, and at the greenhouse
roof on the right with the water
sliding off it, and the Church tower that
rose behind that. It was all in favour of
my going steadily on; no likelihood of a
clearing up for hours to come. I, therefore,
returned to the shelves, lifted out a set of
eight or nine volumes, lettered &#8220;Tracts,&#8221;
and conveyed them to the table for closer
examination.</p>

<p>They were for the most part of the reign
of Anne. There was a good deal of <i>The
Late Peace</i>, <i>The Late War</i>, <i>The Conduct
of the Allies</i>: there were also <i>Letters to a
Convocation Man</i>; <i>Sermons preached at St
Michael&#8217;s, Queenhithe</i>; <i>Enquiries into a late
Charge of the Rt. Rev. the Lord Bishop of
Winchester</i> (or more probably Winton) <i>to
his Clergy</i>: things all very lively once, and
indeed still keeping so much of their old
sting that I was tempted to betake myself
into an armchair in the window, and give
them more time than I had intended. Besides,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
I was somewhat tired by the day.
The Church clock struck four, and it really
was four, for in 1889 there was no saving of
daylight.</p>

<p>So I settled myself. And first I glanced
over some of the War pamphlets, and pleased
myself by trying to pick out Swift by his
style from among the undistinguished. But
the War pamphlets needed more knowledge
of the geography of the Low Countries than
I had. I turned to the Church, and read
several pages of what the Dean of Canterbury
said to the Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge on the occasion of their anniversary
meeting in 1711. When I turned over
to a Letter from a Beneficed Clergyman in
the Country to the Bishop of C....r, I
was becoming languid, and I gazed for some
moments at the following sentence without
surprise:</p>

<p>&#8220;This Abuse (for I think myself justified
in calling it by that name) is one which I
am persuaded Your Lordship would (if
&#8217;twere known to you) exert your utmost
efforts to do away. But I am also persuaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
that you know no more of its existence than
(in the words of the Country Song)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8216;That which walks in Betton Wood</div>
<div class="indent">Knows why it walks or why it cries.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then indeed I did sit up in my chair, and
run my finger along the lines to make sure
that I had read them right. There was no
mistake. Nothing more was to be gathered
from the rest of the pamphlet. The next
paragraph definitely changed the subject:
&#8220;But I have said enough upon this <i>Topick</i>&#8221;
were its opening words. So discreet, too, was
the namelessness of the Beneficed Clergyman
that he refrained even from initials,
and had his letter printed in London.</p>

<p>The riddle was of a kind that might
faintly interest anyone: to me, who have
dabbled a good deal in works of folklore, it
was really exciting. I was set upon solving
it&mdash;on finding out, I mean, what story lay
behind it; and, at least, I felt myself lucky
in one point, that, whereas I might have
come on the paragraph in some College
Library far away, here I was at Betton, on
the very scene of action.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>The Church clock struck five, and a
single stroke on a gong followed. This,
I knew, meant tea. I heaved myself out of
the deep chair, and obeyed the summons.</p>

<p>My host and I were alone at the Court.
He came in soon, wet from a round of landlord&#8217;s
errands, and with pieces of local news
which had to be passed on before I could
make an opportunity of asking whether
there was a particular place in the Parish
that was still known as Betton Wood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betton Wood,&#8221; he said, &#8220;was a short
mile away, just on the crest of Betton Hill,
and my father stubbed up the last bit of it
when it paid better to grow corn than scrub
oaks. Why do you want to know about
Betton Wood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; I said, &#8220;in an old pamphlet I
was reading just now, there are two lines of
a country song which mention it, and they
sound as if there was a story belonging to
them. Someone says that someone else
knows no more of whatever it may be&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8216;Than that which walks in Betton Wood</div>
<div class="indent">Knows why it walks or why it cries.&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;Goodness,&#8221; said Philipson, &#8220;I wonder
whether that was why.... I must ask old
Mitchell.&#8221; He muttered something else to
himself, and took some more tea, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether that was why&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was going to say, whether that
was why my father had the Wood stubbed
up. I said just now it was to get more
plough-land, but I don&#8217;t really know if it
was. I don&#8217;t believe he ever broke it up:
it&#8217;s rough pasture at this moment. But
there&#8217;s one old chap at least who&#8217;d remember
something of it&mdash;old Mitchell.&#8221; He looked
at his watch. &#8220;Blest if I don&#8217;t go down
there and ask him. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll take
you,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;he&#8217;s not so likely to tell
anything he thinks is odd if there&#8217;s a
stranger by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mind you remember every single
thing he does tell. As for me, if it clears
up, I shall go out, and if it doesn&#8217;t, I shall
go on with the books.&#8221;</p>

<p>It did clear up, sufficiently at least to
make me think it worth while to walk up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the nearest hill and look over the country.
I did not know the lie of the land; it was
the first visit I had paid to Philipson, and
this was the first day of it. So I went
down the garden and through the wet shrubberies
with a very open mind, and offered
no resistance to the indistinct impulse&mdash;was
it, however, so very indistinct?&mdash;which kept
urging me to bear to the left whenever
there was a forking of the path. The
result was that after ten minutes or more of
dark going between dripping rows of box
and laurel and privet, I was confronted by a
stone arch in the Gothic style set in the
stone wall which encircled the whole
demesne. The door was fastened by a
spring-lock, and I took the precaution of
leaving this on the jar as I passed out into
the road. That road I crossed, and entered
a narrow lane between hedges which led
upward; and that lane I pursued at a
leisurely pace for as much as half-a-mile,
and went on to the field to which it led. I
was now on a good point of vantage for
taking in the situation of the Court, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
village, and the environment; and I leant
upon a gate and gazed westward and downward.</p>

<p>I think we must all know the landscapes&mdash;are
they by Birket Foster, or somewhat
earlier?&mdash;which, in the form of wood-cuts,
decorate the volumes of poetry that lay on
the drawing-room tables of our fathers and
grandfathers&mdash;volumes in &#8220;Art Cloth, embossed
bindings&#8221;; that strikes me as being
the right phrase. I confess myself an
admirer of them, and especially of those
which show the peasant leaning over a gate
in a hedge and surveying, at the bottom of
a downward slope, the village church spire&mdash;embosomed
amid venerable trees, and a
fertile plain intersected by hedgerows, and
bounded by distant hills, behind which the
orb of day is sinking (or it may be rising)
amid level clouds illumined by his dying
(or nascent) ray. The expressions employed
here are those which seem appropriate to
the pictures I have in mind; and were there
opportunity, I would try to work in the
Vale, the Grove, the Cot, and the Flood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Anyhow, they are beautiful to me, these
landscapes, and it was just such a one that
I was now surveying. It might have come
straight out of &#8220;Gems of Sacred Song,
selected by a Lady&#8221; and given as a birthday
present to Eleanor Philipson in 1852 by her
attached friend Millicent Graves. All at
once I turned as if I had been stung.
There thrilled into my right ear and pierced
my head a note of incredible sharpness, like
the shriek of a bat, only ten times intensified&mdash;the
kind of thing that makes one wonder
if something has not given way in one&#8217;s
brain. I held my breath, and covered my
ear, and shivered. Something in the circulation:
another minute or two, I thought,
and I return home. But I must fix the
view a little more firmly in my mind.
Only, when I turned to it again, the taste
was gone out of it. The sun was down
behind the hill, and the light was off the
fields, and when the clock bell in the
Church tower struck seven, I thought no
longer of kind mellow evening hours of rest,
and scents of flowers and woods on evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
air; and of how someone on a farm a mile or
two off would be saying &#8220;How clear Betton
bell sounds to-night after the rain!&#8221;; but
instead images came to me of dusty beams
and creeping spiders and savage owls up in
the tower, and forgotten graves and their
ugly contents below, and of flying Time and
all it had taken out of my life. And just
then into my left ear&mdash;close as if lips had
been put within an inch of my head, the
frightful scream came thrilling again.</p>

<p>There was no mistake possible now. It
<i>was</i> from outside. &#8220;With no language but
a cry&#8221; was the thought that flashed into my
mind. Hideous it was beyond anything I
had heard or have heard since, but I could
read no emotion in it, and doubted if I could
read any intelligence. All its effect was to
take away every vestige, every possibility,
of enjoyment, and make this no place to
stay in one moment more. Of course there
was nothing to be seen: but I was convinced
that, if I waited, the thing would pass me
again on its aimless, endless beat, and I could
not bear the notion of a third repetition. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
hurried back to the lane and down the hill.
But when I came to the arch in the wall I
stopped. Could I be sure of my way among
those dank alleys, which would be danker
and darker now? No, I confessed to myself
that I was afraid: so jarred were all my
nerves with the cry on the hill that I really
felt I could not afford to be startled even by
a little bird in a bush, or a rabbit. I followed
the road which followed the wall, and I was
not sorry when I came to the gate and the
lodge, and descried Philipson coming up towards
it from the direction of the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where have you been?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took that lane that goes up the hill
opposite the stone arch in the wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! did you? Then you&#8217;ve been very
near where Betton Wood used to be: at
least, if you followed it up to the top,
and out into the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>And if the reader will believe it, that
was the first time that I put two and two
together. Did I at once tell Philipson
what had happened to me? I did not. I
have not had other experiences of the kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
which are called super-natural, or -normal,
or -physical, but, though I knew very well
I must speak of this one before long, I was
not at all anxious to do so; and I think
I have read that this is a common case.</p>

<p>So all I said was: &#8220;Did you see the old
man you meant to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Mitchell? Yes, I did; and got
something of a story out of him. I&#8217;ll keep
it till after dinner. It really is rather
odd.&#8221;</p>

<p>So when we were settled after dinner he
began to report, faithfully, as he said, the
dialogue that had taken place. Mitchell,
not far off eighty years old, was in his
elbow-chair. The married daughter with
whom he lived was in and out preparing
for tea.</p>

<p>After the usual salutations: &#8220;Mitchell,
I want you to tell me something about
the Wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What Wood&#8217;s that, Master Reginald?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Betton Wood. Do you remember it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mitchell slowly raised his hand and
pointed an accusing forefinger. &#8220;It were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
your father done away with Betton Wood,
Master Reginald, I can tell you that much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know it was, Mitchell. You
needn&#8217;t look at me as if it were my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your fault? No, I says it were your
father done it, before your time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I dare say if the truth was
known, it was your father that advised
him to do it, and I want to know why.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mitchell seemed a little amused. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;my father were woodman to your
father and your grandfather before him, and
if he didn&#8217;t know what belonged to his
business, he&#8217;d oughter done. And if he did
give advice that way, I suppose he might
have had his reasons, mightn&#8217;t he now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he might, and I want you to
tell me what they were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, Master Reginald, whatever
makes you think as I know what his
reasons might &#8217;a been I don&#8217;t know how
many year ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, to be sure, it is a long time, and
you might easily have forgotten, if ever
you knew. I suppose the only thing is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
for me to go and ask old Ellis what he
can recollect about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That had the effect I hoped for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Ellis!&#8221; he growled. &#8220;First time
ever I hear anyone say old Ellis were any
use for any purpose. I should &#8217;a thought you
know&#8217;d better than that yourself, Master
Reginald. What do you suppose old Ellis
can tell you better&#8217;n what I can about
Betton Wood, and what call have he got
to be put afore me, I should like to know.
His father warn&#8217;t woodman on the place:
he were ploughman&mdash;that&#8217;s what he was,
and so anyone could tell you what knows;
anyone could tell you that, I says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so, Mitchell, but if you know all
about Betton Wood and won&#8217;t tell me,
why, I must do the next best I can, and
try and get it out of somebody else; and
old Ellis has been on the place very nearly
as long as you have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he ain&#8217;t, not by eighteen months!
Who says I wouldn&#8217;t tell you nothing about
the Wood? I ain&#8217;t no objection; only it&#8217;s
a funny kind of a tale, and &#8217;taint right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
my thinkin&#8217; it should be all about the
Parish. You, Lizzie, do you keep in your
kitchen a bit. Me and Master Reginald
wants to have a word or two private. But
one thing I&#8217;d like to know, Master Reginald,
what come to put you upon asking about
it to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! well, I happened to hear of an
old saying about something that walks in
Betton Wood. And I wondered if that
had anything to do with its being cleared
away: that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you was in the right, Master
Reginald, however you come to hear of it,
and I believe I can tell you the rights of
it better than anyone in this Parish, let
alone old Ellis. You see it came about
this way: that the shortest road to Allen&#8217;s
Farm laid through the Wood, and when
we was little my poor mother she used to
go so many times in the week to the farm
to fetch a quart of milk, because Mr Allen
what had the farm then under your father,
he was a good man, and anyone that had
a young family to bring up, he was willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
to allow &#8217;em so much in the week. But
never you mind about that now. And my
poor mother she never liked to go through
the Wood, because there was a lot of talk
in the place, and sayings like what you
spoke about just now. But every now and
again, when she happened to be late with
her work, she&#8217;d have to take the short
road through the Wood, and as sure as
ever she did, she&#8217;d come home in a rare
state. I remember her and my father talking
about it, and he&#8217;d say, &#8216;Well, but it
can&#8217;t do you no harm, Emma,&#8217; and she&#8217;d
say, &#8216;Oh! but you haven&#8217;t an idear of it,
George. Why, it went right through my
head,&#8217; she says, &#8216;and I came over all bewildered-like,
and as if I didn&#8217;t know where
I was. You see, George,&#8217; she says, &#8216;it ain&#8217;t
as if you was about there in the dusk. You
always goes there in the daytime, now
don&#8217;t you?&#8217; and he says: &#8216;Why, to be sure
I do, do you take me for a fool?&#8217; And
so they&#8217;d go on. And time passed by,
and I think it wore her out, because, you
understand, it warn&#8217;t no use to go for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
milk not till the afternoon, and she wouldn&#8217;t
never send none of us children instead,
for fear we should get a fright. Nor she
wouldn&#8217;t tell us about it herself. &#8216;No,&#8217; she
says, &#8216;it&#8217;s bad enough for me. I don&#8217;t want
no one else to go through it, nor yet hear
talk about it.&#8217; But one time I recollect
she says, &#8216;Well, first it&#8217;s a rustling-like all
along in the bushes, coming very quick,
either towards me or after me according
to the time, and then there comes this
scream as appears to pierce right through
from the one ear to the other, and the later
I am coming through, the more like I am
to hear it twice over; but thanks be, I
never yet heard it the three times.&#8217; And
then I asked her, and I says: &#8216;Why, that
seems like someone walking to and fro all
the time, don&#8217;t it?&#8217; and she says, &#8216;Yes, it
do, and whatever it is she wants, I can&#8217;t
think&#8217;: and I says, &#8216;Is it a woman,
mother?&#8217; and she says, &#8216;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard
it is a woman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, the end of it was my father
he spoke to your father, and told him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
Wood was a bad wood. &#8216;There&#8217;s never a
bit of game in it, and there&#8217;s never a bird&#8217;s
nest there,&#8217; he says, &#8216;and it ain&#8217;t no manner
of use to you.&#8217; And after a lot of talk,
your father he come and see my mother
about it, and he see she warn&#8217;t one of these
silly women as gets nervish about nothink
at all, and he made up his mind there was
somethink in it, and after that he asked
about in the neighbourhood, and I believe
he made out somethink, and wrote it down
in a paper what very like you&#8217;ve got up at
the Court, Master Reginald. And then he
gave the order, and the Wood was stubbed
up. They done all the work in the daytime,
I recollect, and was never there after
three o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they find anything to explain it,
Mitchell? No bones or anything of that
kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothink at all, Master Reginald, only
the mark of a hedge and ditch along the
middle, much about where the quickset
hedge run now, and with all the work they
done, if there had been anyone put away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
there, they was bound to find &#8217;em. But
I don&#8217;t know whether it done much good,
after all. People here don&#8217;t seem to like
the place no better than they did afore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about what I got out of Mitchell,&#8221;
said Philipson, &#8220;and as far as any explanation
goes, it leaves us very much where
we were. I must see if I can&#8217;t find that
paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t your father ever tell you
about the business?&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He died before I went to school, you
know, and I imagine he didn&#8217;t want to
frighten us children by any such story. I
can remember being shaken and slapped by
my nurse for running up that lane towards
the Wood when we were coming back
rather late one winter afternoon: but in
the daytime no one interfered with our
going into the Wood if we wanted to&mdash;only
we never did want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm!&#8221; I said, and then, &#8220;Do you think
you&#8217;ll be able to find that paper that your
father wrote?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I do. I expect it&#8217;s no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
further away than that cupboard behind you.
There&#8217;s a bundle or two of things specially
put aside, most of which I&#8217;ve looked through
at various times, and I know there&#8217;s one
envelope labelled Betton Wood: but as
there was no Betton Wood any more, I
never thought it would be worth while to
open it, and I never have. We&#8217;ll do it now,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before you do,&#8221; I said (I was still reluctant,
but I thought this was perhaps the
moment for my disclosure), &#8220;I&#8217;d better tell
you I think Mitchell was right when he
doubted if clearing away the Wood had put
things straight.&#8221; And I gave the account
you have heard already: I need not say
Philipson was interested. &#8220;Still there?&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing. Look here, will you
come out there with me now, and see what
happens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do no such thing,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and
if you knew the feeling, you&#8217;d be glad to
walk ten miles in the opposite direction.
Don&#8217;t talk of it. Open your envelope, and
let&#8217;s hear what your father made out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>He did so, and read me the three or four
pages of jottings which it contained. At
the top was written a motto from Scott&#8217;s
<i>Glenfinlas</i>, which seemed to me well-chosen:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Where walks, they say, the shrieking ghost.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there were notes of his talk with
Mitchell&#8217;s mother, from which I extract
only this much. &#8220;I asked her if she never
thought she saw anything to account for the
sounds she heard. She told me, no more
than once, on the darkest evening she ever
came through the Wood; and then she
seemed forced to look behind her as the
rustling came in the bushes, and she thought
she saw something all in tatters with the
two arms held out in front of it coming on
very fast, and at that she ran for the stile,
and tore her gown all to flinders getting
over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he had gone to two other people
whom he found very shy of talking. They
seemed to think, among other things, that it
reflected discredit on the parish. However,
one, Mrs Emma Frost, was prevailed upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
to repeat what her mother had told her.
&#8220;They say it was a lady of title that married
twice over, and her first husband went by
the name of Brown, or it might have been
Bryan (&#8220;Yes, there were Bryans at the Court
before it came into our family,&#8221; Philipson
put in), and she removed her neighbour&#8217;s
landmark: leastways she took in a fair piece
of the best pasture in Betton Parish what
belonged by rights to two children as hadn&#8217;t
no one to speak for them, and they say years
after she went from bad to worse, and made
out false papers to gain thousands of pounds
up in London, and at last they was proved
in law to be false, and she would have been
tried and put to death very like, only she
escaped away for the time. But no one can&#8217;t
avoid the curse that&#8217;s laid on them that removes
the landmark, and so we take it she
can&#8217;t leave Betton before someone take and
put it right again.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the end of the paper there was a note
to this effect. &#8220;I regret that I cannot find
any clue to previous owners of the fields
adjoining the Wood. I do not hesitate to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
say that if I could discover their representatives,
I should do my best to indemnify them
for the wrong done to them in years now
long past: for it is undeniable that the Wood
is very curiously disturbed in the manner
described by the people of the place. In
my present ignorance alike of the extent of
the land wrongly appropriated, and of the
rightful owners, I am reduced to keeping a
separate note of the profits derived from this
part of the estate, and my custom has been
to apply the sum that would represent the
annual yield of about five acres to the
common benefit of the Parish and to charitable
uses: and I hope that those who
succeed me may see fit to continue this
practice.&#8221;</p>

<p>So much for the elder Mr Philipson&#8217;s paper.
To those who, like myself, are readers of the
State Trials it will have gone far to illuminate
the situation. They will remember how
between the years 1678 and 1684 the Lady
Ivy, formerly Theodosia Bryan, was alternately
Plaintiff and Defendant in a series of
trials in which she was trying to establish a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
claim against the Dean and Chapter of St
Paul&#8217;s for a considerable and very valuable
tract of land in Shadwell: how in the last
of those trials, presided over by L.C.J.
Jeffreys, it was proved up to the hilt that
the deeds upon which she based her claim
were forgeries executed under her orders:
and how, after an information for perjury
and forgery was issued against her, she disappeared
completely&mdash;so completely, indeed,
that no expert has ever been able to tell me
what became of her.</p>

<p>Does not the story I have told suggest
that she may still be heard of on the scene
of one of her earlier and more successful
exploits?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said my friend, as he folded
up his papers, &#8220;is a very faithful record of
my one extraordinary experience. And
now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But I had so many questions to ask him,
as for instance, whether his friend had found
the proper owner of the land, whether he
had done anything about the hedge, whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the sounds were ever heard now, what was
the exact title and date of his pamphlet, etc.,
etc., that bed-time came and passed, without
his having an opportunity to revert to the
Literary Supplement of the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A VIEW FROM A HILL</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HOW pleasant it can be, alone in a
first-class railway carriage, on the
first day of a holiday that is to be fairly
long, to dawdle through a bit of English
country that is unfamiliar, stopping at every
station. You have a map open on your
knee, and you pick out the villages that
lie to right and left by their church towers.
You marvel at the complete stillness that
attends your stoppage at the stations,
broken only by a footstep crunching the
gravel. Yet perhaps that is best experienced
after sundown, and the traveller I
have in mind was making his leisurely progress
on a sunny afternoon in the latter
half of June.</p>

<p>He was in the depths of the country.
I need not particularise further than to say
that if you divided the map of England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
into four quarters, he would have been
found in the south-western of them.</p>

<p>He was a man of academic pursuits, and
his term was just over. He was on his way
to meet a new friend, older than himself.
The two of them had met first on an official
enquiry in town, had found that they had
many tastes and habits in common, liked
each other, and the result was an invitation
from Squire Richards to Mr Fanshawe which
was now taking effect.</p>

<p>The journey ended about five o&#8217;clock.
Fanshawe was told by a cheerful country
porter that the car from the Hall had been
up to the station and left a message that
something had to be fetched from half-a-mile
farther on, and would the gentleman
please to wait a few minutes till it came
back? &#8220;But I see,&#8221; continued the porter,
&#8220;as you&#8217;ve got your bysticle, and very like
you&#8217;d find it pleasanter to ride up to the
&#8217;All yourself. Straight up the road &#8217;ere,
and then first turn to the left&mdash;it ain&#8217;t
above two mile&mdash;and I&#8217;ll see as your things
is put in the car for you. You&#8217;ll excuse me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
mentioning it, only I thought it were a nice
evening for a ride. Yes, sir, very seasonable
weather for the haymakers: let me
see, I have your bike ticket. Thank you,
sir; much obliged: you can&#8217;t miss your
road, etc., etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two miles to the Hall were just what
was needed, after the day in the train, to
dispel somnolence and impart a wish for
tea. The Hall, when sighted, also promised
just what was needed in the way of a quiet
resting-place after days of sitting on
committees and college-meetings. It was
neither excitingly old nor depressingly new.
Plastered walls, sash-windows, old trees,
smooth lawns, were the features which
Fanshawe noticed as he came up the drive.
Squire Richards, a burly man of sixty odd,
was awaiting him in the porch with evident
pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tea first,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or would you like a
longer drink? No? All right, tea&#8217;s ready in
the garden. Come along, they&#8217;ll put your
machine away. I always have tea under the
lime-tree by the stream on a day like this.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Nor could you ask for a better place.
Midsummer afternoon, shade and scent of
a vast lime-tree, cool, swirling water within
five yards. It was long before either of
them suggested a move. But about six,
Mr Richards sat up, knocked out his pipe,
and said: &#8220;Look here, it&#8217;s cool enough
now to think of a stroll, if you&#8217;re inclined?
All right: then what I suggest is that we
walk up the park and get on to the hillside,
where we can look over the country.
We&#8217;ll have a map, and I&#8217;ll show you where
things are; and you can go off on your
machine, or we can take the car, according
as you want exercise or not. If you&#8217;re
ready, we can start now and be back well
before eight, taking it very easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready. I should like my stick,
though, and have you got any field-glasses?
I lent mine to a man a week ago, and he&#8217;s
gone off Lord knows where and taken them
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr Richards pondered. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I have, but they&#8217;re not things I use
myself, and I don&#8217;t know whether the ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
I have will suit you. They&#8217;re old-fashioned,
and about twice as heavy as they make &#8217;em
now. You&#8217;re welcome to have them, but
<i>I</i> won&#8217;t carry them. By the way, what do
you want to drink after dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>Protestations that anything would do
were overruled, and a satisfactory settlement
was reached on the way to the front
hall, where Mr Fanshawe found his stick,
and Mr Richards, after thoughtful pinching
of his lower lip, resorted to a drawer in the
hall-table, extracted a key, crossed to a
cupboard in the panelling, opened it, took
a box from the shelf, and put it on the
table. &#8220;The glasses are in there,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and there&#8217;s some dodge of opening it, but
I&#8217;ve forgotten what it is. You try.&#8221; Mr
Fanshawe accordingly tried. There was no
keyhole, and the box was solid, heavy and
smooth: it seemed obvious that some part
of it would have to be pressed before
anything could happen. &#8220;The corners,&#8221;
said he to himself, &#8220;are the likely places;
and infernally sharp corners they are
too,&#8221; he added, as he put his thumb in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
his mouth after exerting force on a lower
corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; said the Squire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, your disgusting Borgia box has
scratched me, drat it,&#8221; said Fanshawe. The
Squire chuckled unfeelingly. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve
got it open, anyway,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have! Well, I don&#8217;t begrudge a
drop of blood in a good cause, and here are
the glasses. They <i>are</i> pretty heavy, as you
said, but I think I&#8217;m equal to carrying them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; said the Squire. &#8220;Come on
then; we go out by the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they did, and passed out into the park,
which sloped decidedly upwards to the hill
which, as Fanshawe had seen from the train,
dominated the country. It was a spur of a
larger range that lay behind. On the way,
the Squire, who was great on earthworks,
pointed out various spots where he detected
or imagined traces of war-ditches and the
like. &#8220;And here,&#8221; he said, stopping on a
more or less level plot with a ring of large
trees, &#8220;is Baxter&#8217;s Roman villa.&#8221; &#8220;Baxter?&#8221;
said Mr Fanshawe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;I forgot; you don&#8217;t know about him.
He was the old chap I got those glasses
from. I believe he made them. He was
an old watch-maker down in the village, a
great antiquary. My father gave him leave
to grub about where he liked; and when he
made a find he used to lend him a man or
two to help him with the digging. He
got a surprising lot of things together, and
when he died&mdash;I dare say it&#8217;s ten or fifteen
years ago&mdash;I bought the whole lot and
gave them to the town museum. We&#8217;ll
run in one of these days, and look over
them. The glasses came to me with the
rest, but of course I kept them. If you
look at them, you&#8217;ll see they&#8217;re more or less
amateur work&mdash;the body of them; naturally
the lenses weren&#8217;t his making.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I see they are just the sort of
thing that a clever workman in a different
line of business might turn out. But I
don&#8217;t see why he made them so heavy.
And did Baxter actually find a Roman
villa here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s a pavement turfed over,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
where we&#8217;re standing: it was too rough and
plain to be worth taking up, but of course
there are drawings of it: and the small
things and pottery that turned up were
quite good of their kind. An ingenious
chap, old Baxter: he seemed to have a
quite out-of-the-way instinct for these
things. He was invaluable to our arch&aelig;ologists.
He used to shut up his shop for
days at a time, and wander off over the
district, marking down places, where he
scented anything, on the ordnance map;
and he kept a book with fuller notes of
the places. Since his death, a good many
of them have been sampled, and there&#8217;s
always been something to justify him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a good man!&#8221; said Mr Fanshawe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good?&#8221; said the Squire, pulling up
brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant useful to have about the place,&#8221;
said Mr Fanshawe. &#8220;But was he a villain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that either,&#8221; said
the Squire; &#8220;but all I can say is, if he was
good, he wasn&#8217;t lucky. And he wasn&#8217;t liked:
I didn&#8217;t like him,&#8221; he added, after a moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;Oh?&#8221; said Fanshawe, interrogatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t; but that&#8217;s enough about
Baxter: besides, this is the stiffest bit, and
I don&#8217;t want to talk and walk as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed it was hot, climbing a slippery
grass slope that evening. &#8220;I told you I
should take you the short way,&#8221; panted the
Squire, &#8220;and I wish I hadn&#8217;t. However,
a bath won&#8217;t do us any harm when we get
back. Here we are, and there&#8217;s the seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>A small clump of old Scotch firs crowned
the top of the hill; and, at the edge of it,
commanding the cream of the view, was a
wide and solid seat, on which the two disposed
themselves, and wiped their brows,
and regained breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; said the Squire, as soon as
he was in a condition to talk connectedly,
&#8220;this is where your glasses come in. But
you&#8217;d better take a general look round first.
My word! I&#8217;ve never seen the view look
better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Writing as I am now with a winter wind
flapping against dark windows and a rushing,
tumbling sea within a hundred yards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
I find it hard to summon up the feelings
and words which will put my reader in
possession of the June evening and the
lovely English landscape of which the Squire
was speaking.</p>

<p>Across a broad level plain they looked
upon ranges of great hills, whose uplands&mdash;some
green, some furred with woods&mdash;caught
the light of a sun, westering but
not yet low. And all the plain was fertile,
though the river which traversed it was
nowhere seen. There were copses, green
wheat, hedges and pasture-land: the little
compact white moving cloud marked the
evening train. Then the eye picked out
red farms and grey houses, and nearer
home scattered cottages, and then the
Hall, nestled under the hill. The smoke
of chimneys was very blue and straight.
There was a smell of hay in the air: there
were wild roses on bushes hard by. It was
the acme of summer.</p>

<p>After some minutes of silent contemplation,
the Squire began to point out the
leading features, the hills and valleys, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
told where the towns and villages lay.
&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;with the glasses you&#8217;ll be
able to pick out Fulnaker Abbey. Take
a line across that big green field, then over
the wood beyond it, then over the farm on
the knoll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; said Fanshawe. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
it. What a fine tower!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have got the wrong direction,&#8221;
said the Squire; &#8220;there&#8217;s not much
of a tower about there that I remember,
unless it&#8217;s Oldbourne Church that you&#8217;ve
got hold of. And if you call that a fine
tower, you&#8217;re easily pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do call it a fine tower,&#8221; said
Fanshawe, the glasses still at his eyes,
&#8220;whether it&#8217;s Oldbourne or any other. And
it must belong to a largish church&mdash;it
looks to me like a central tower; four big
pinnacles at the corners, and four smaller
ones between. I must certainly go over
there. How far is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oldbourne&#8217;s about nine miles, or less,&#8221;
said the Squire. &#8220;It&#8217;s a long time since
I&#8217;ve been there, but I don&#8217;t remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
thinking much of it. Now I&#8217;ll show you
another thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanshawe had lowered the glasses, and
was still gazing in the Oldbourne direction.
&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t make out anything
with the naked eye. What was it you were
going to show me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good deal more to the left&mdash;it
oughtn&#8217;t to be difficult to find. Do you
see a rather sudden knob of a hill with a
thick wood on top of it? It&#8217;s in a dead
line with that single tree on the top of the
big ridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Fanshawe, &#8220;and I believe
I could tell you without much difficulty
what it&#8217;s called.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you now?&#8221; said the Squire.
&#8220;Say on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Gallows Hill,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you guess that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you don&#8217;t want it guessed, you
shouldn&#8217;t put up a dummy gibbet and a
man hanging on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said the Squire abruptly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing on that hill but wood.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; said Fanshawe, &#8220;there&#8217;s
a largish expanse of grass on the top and your
dummy gibbet in the middle; and I thought
there was something on it when I looked
first. But I see there&#8217;s nothing&mdash;or is there?
I can&#8217;t be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, nonsense, Fanshawe, there&#8217;s
no such thing as a dummy gibbet, or any
other sort, on that hill. And it&#8217;s thick wood&mdash;a
fairly young plantation. I was in it
myself not a year ago. Hand me the glasses,
though I don&#8217;t suppose I can see anything.&#8221;
After a pause: &#8220;No, I thought not: they
won&#8217;t show a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fanshawe was scanning the
hill&mdash;it might be only two or three miles
away. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s very odd,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it
does look exactly like a wood without the
glass.&#8221; He took it again. &#8220;That <i>is</i> one of
the oddest effects. The gibbet is perfectly
plain, and the grass field, and there even seem
to be people on it, and carts, or <i>a</i> cart, with
men in it. And yet when I take the glass
away, there&#8217;s nothing. It must be something
in the way this afternoon light falls: I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
come up earlier in the day when the sun&#8217;s
full on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say you saw people and a cart
on that hill?&#8221; said the Squire incredulously.
&#8220;What should they be doing there at this
time of day, even if the trees have been
felled? Do talk sense&mdash;look again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I certainly thought I saw them.
Yes, I should say there were a few, just
clearing off. And now&mdash;by Jove, it does
look like something hanging on the gibbet.
But these glasses are so beastly heavy I
can&#8217;t hold them steady for long. Anyhow,
you can take it from me there&#8217;s no wood.
And if you&#8217;ll show me the road on the map,
I&#8217;ll go there to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Squire remained brooding for some
little time. At last he rose and said, &#8220;Well,
I suppose that will be the best way to settle
it. And now we&#8217;d better be getting back.
Bath and dinner is my idea.&#8221; And on the
way back he was not very communicative.</p>

<p>They returned through the garden, and
went into the great hall to leave sticks, etc.,
in their due place. And here they found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the aged butler Patten evidently in a state
of some anxiety. &#8220;Beg pardon, Master
Henry,&#8221; he began at once, &#8220;but someone&#8217;s
been up to mischief here, I&#8217;m much afraid.&#8221;
He pointed to the open box which had contained
the glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing worse than that, Patten?&#8221; said
the Squire. &#8220;Mayn&#8217;t I take out my own
glasses and lend them to a friend? Bought
with my own money, you recollect? At
old Baxter&#8217;s sale, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Patten bowed, unconvinced. &#8220;O, very
well, Master Henry, as long as you know
who it was. Only I thought proper to name
it, for I didn&#8217;t think that box&#8217;d been off its
shelf since you first put it there; and, if
you&#8217;ll excuse me, after what happened....&#8221;
The voice was lowered, and the rest was not
audible to Fanshawe. The Squire replied
with a few words and a gruff laugh, and
called on Fanshawe to come and be shown
his room. And I do not think that anything
else happened that night which bears
on my story.</p>

<p>Except, perhaps, the sensation which invaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Fanshawe in the small hours that
something had been let out which ought
not to have been let out. It came into his
dreams. He was walking in a garden which
he seemed half to know, and stopped in front
of a rockery made of old wrought stones,
pieces of window tracery from a church, and
even bits of figures. One of these moved
his curiosity: it seemed to be a sculptured
capital with scenes carved on it. He felt
he must pull it out, and worked away, and,
with an ease that surprised him, moved the
stones that obscured it aside, and pulled out
the block. As he did so, a tin label fell
down by his feet with a little clatter. He
picked it up and read on it: &#8220;On no account
move this stone. Yours sincerely, J. Patten.&#8221;
As often happens in dreams, he felt that this
injunction was of extreme importance; and
with an anxiety that amounted to anguish
he looked to see if the stone had really been
shifted. Indeed it had; in fact he could not
see it anywhere. The removal had disclosed
the mouth of a burrow, and he bent down
to look into it. Something stirred in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
blackness, and then, to his intense horror, a
hand emerged&mdash;a clean right hand in a neat
cuff and coat-sleeve, just in the attitude of
a hand that means to shake yours. He
wondered whether it would not be rude to let
it alone. But, as he looked at it, it began
to grow hairy and dirty and thin, and also
to change its pose and stretch out as if to
take hold of his leg. At that he dropped
all thought of politeness, decided to run,
screamed and woke himself up.</p>

<p>This was the dream he remembered; but it
seemed to him (as, again, it often does) that
there had been others of the same import
before, but not so insistent. He lay awake
for some little time, fixing the details of the
last dream in his mind, and wondering in
particular what the figures had been which
he had seen or half seen on the carved capital.
Something quite incongruous, he felt sure;
but that was the most he could recall.</p>

<p>Whether because of the dream, or because
it was the first day of his holiday, he did not
get up very early; nor did he at once plunge
into the exploration of the country. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
spent a morning, half lazy, half instructive,
in looking over the volumes of the County
Arch&aelig;ological Society&#8217;s transactions, in which
were many contributions from Mr Baxter on
finds of flint implements, Roman sites, ruins
of monastic establishments; in fact, most
departments of arch&aelig;ology. They were
written in an odd, pompous, only half-educated
style. If the man had had more early
schooling, thought Fanshawe, he would have
been a very distinguished antiquary; or he
might have been (he thus qualified his opinion
a little later), but for a certain love of opposition
and controversy, and, yes, a patronising
tone as of one possessing superior knowledge,
which left an unpleasant taste. He might
have been a very respectable artist. There
was an imaginary restoration and elevation
of a priory church which was very well conceived.
A fine pinnacled central tower was
a conspicuous feature of this; it reminded
Fanshawe of that which he had seen from
the hill, and which the Squire had told him
must be Oldbourne. But it was not Oldbourne;
it was Fulnaker Priory. &#8220;Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
well,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;I suppose Oldbourne
Church may have been built by
Fulnaker monks, and Baxter has copied
Oldbourne tower. Anything about it in
the letterpress? Ah, I see it was published
after his death,&mdash;found among his papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>After lunch the Squire asked Fanshawe
what he meant to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Fanshawe, &#8220;I think I shall
go out on my bike about four as far as
Oldbourne and back by Gallows Hill. That
ought to be a round of about fifteen miles,
oughtn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About that,&#8221; said the Squire, &#8220;and
you&#8217;ll pass Lambsfield and Wanstone, both
of which are worth looking at. There&#8217;s a
little glass at Lambsfield and the stone at
Wanstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Fanshawe, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get tea
somewhere, and may I take the glasses?
I&#8217;ll strap them on my bike, on the carrier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, if you like,&#8221; said the Squire.
&#8220;I really ought to have some better ones.
If I go into the town to-day, I&#8217;ll see if I
can pick up some.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;Why should you trouble to do that,
if you can&#8217;t use them yourself?&#8221; said
Fanshawe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know; one ought to have
a decent pair; and&mdash;well, old Patten doesn&#8217;t
think those are fit to use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a judge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got some tale: I don&#8217;t know:
something about old Baxter. I&#8217;ve promised
to let him tell me about it. It seems very
much on his mind since last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why that? Did he have a nightmare
like me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had something: he was looking an
old man this morning, and he said he hadn&#8217;t
closed an eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let him save up his tale till I
come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I will if I can. Look here,
are you going to be late? If you get a
puncture eight miles off and have to walk
home, what then? I don&#8217;t trust these
bicycles: I shall tell them to give us cold
things to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t mind that, whether I&#8217;m late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
or early. But I&#8217;ve got things to mend
punctures with. And now I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was just as well that the Squire had
made that arrangement about a cold supper,
Fanshawe thought, and not for the first
time, as he wheeled his bicycle up the drive
about nine o&#8217;clock. So also the Squire
thought and said, several times, as he met
him in the hall, rather pleased at the confirmation
of his want of faith in bicycles
than sympathetic with his hot, weary,
thirsty, and indeed haggard, friend. In
fact, the kindest thing he found to say
was: &#8220;You&#8217;ll want a long drink to-night?
Cider-cup do? All right. Hear that, Patten?
Cider-cup, iced, lots of it.&#8221; Then to Fanshawe,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be all night over your bath.&#8221;</p>

<p>By half-past nine they were at dinner,
and Fanshawe was reporting progress, if
progress it might be called.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got to Lambsfield very smoothly, and
saw the glass. It is very interesting stuff,
but there&#8217;s a lot of lettering I couldn&#8217;t
read.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;Not with glasses?&#8221; said the Squire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those glasses of yours are no manner
of use inside a church&mdash;or inside anywhere,
I suppose, for that matter. But the only
places I took &#8217;em into were churches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Well, go on,&#8221; said the Squire.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, I took some sort of a photograph
of the window, and I dare say an
enlargement would show what I want.
Then Wanstone; I should think that stone
was a very out-of-the-way thing, only I
don&#8217;t know about that class of antiquities.
Has anybody opened the mound it stands
on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Baxter wanted to, but the farmer
wouldn&#8217;t let him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I should think it would be
worth doing. Anyhow, the next thing was
Fulnaker and Oldbourne. You know, it&#8217;s
very odd about that tower I saw from the
hill. Oldbourne Church is nothing like it,
and of course there&#8217;s nothing over thirty
feet high at Fulnaker, though you can see
it had a central tower. I didn&#8217;t tell you,
did I? that Baxter&#8217;s fancy drawing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
Fulnaker shows a tower exactly like the
one I saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you thought, I dare say,&#8221; put in the
Squire.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t a case of thinking. The
picture actually <i>reminded</i> me of what I&#8217;d
seen, and I made sure it was Oldbourne,
well before I looked at the title.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Baxter had a very fair idea of
architecture. I dare say what&#8217;s left made
it easy for him to draw the right sort of
tower.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be it, of course, but I&#8217;m
doubtful if even a professional could have
got it so exactly right. There&#8217;s absolutely
nothing left at Fulnaker but the bases of
the piers which supported it. However,
that isn&#8217;t the oddest thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about Gallows Hill?&#8221; said the
Squire. &#8220;Here, Patten, listen to this. I
told you what Mr Fanshawe said he saw
from the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Master Henry, you did; and I can&#8217;t
say I was so much surprised, considering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, all right. You keep that till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
afterwards. We want to hear what Mr
Fanshawe saw to-day. Go on, Fanshawe.
You turned to come back by Ackford and
Thorfield, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I looked into both the churches.
Then I got to the turning which goes to
the top of Gallows Hill; I saw that if I
wheeled my machine over the field at the
top of the hill I could join the home road
on this side. It was about half-past six
when I got to the top of the hill, and there
was a gate on my right, where it ought to
be, leading into the belt of plantation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear that, Patten? A belt, he
says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I thought it was&mdash;a belt. But it
wasn&#8217;t. You were quite right, and I was
hopelessly wrong. I <i>cannot</i> understand it.
The whole top is planted quite thick.
Well, I went on into this wood, wheeling
and dragging my bike, expecting every
minute to come to a clearing, and then my
misfortunes began. Thorns, I suppose; first
I realised that the front tyre was slack, then
the back. I couldn&#8217;t stop to do more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
try to find the punctures and mark them;
but even that was hopeless. So I ploughed
on, and the farther I went, the less I liked
the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much poaching in that cover, eh,
Patten?&#8221; said the Squire.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, Master Henry: there&#8217;s very
few cares to go&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I know: never mind that now.
Go on, Fanshawe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame anybody for not caring
to go there. I know I had all the fancies
one least likes: steps crackling over twigs
behind me, indistinct people stepping behind
trees in front of me, yes, and even a hand
laid on my shoulder. I pulled up very
sharp at that and looked round, but there
really was no branch or bush that could
have done it. Then, when I was just about
at the middle of the plot, I was convinced
that there was someone looking down on
me from above&mdash;and not with any pleasant
intent. I stopped again, or at least slackened
my pace, to look up. And as I did, down
I came, and barked my shins abominably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
on, what do you think? a block of stone
with a big square hole in the top of it.
And within a few paces there were two
others just like it. The three were set in
a triangle. Now, do you make out what
they were put there for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can,&#8221; said the Squire, who
was now very grave and absorbed in the
story. &#8220;Sit down, Patten.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was time, for the old man was supporting
himself by one hand, and leaning heavily
on it. He dropped into a chair, and said
in a very tremulous voice, &#8220;You didn&#8217;t go
between them stones, did you, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did <i>not</i>,&#8221; said Fanshawe, emphatically.
&#8220;I dare say I was an ass, but as soon
as it dawned on me where I was, I just
shouldered my machine and did my best
to run. It seemed to me as if I was in
an unholy evil sort of graveyard, and I was
most profoundly thankful that it was one
of the longest days and still sunlight. Well,
I had a horrid run, even if it was only a
few hundred yards. Everything caught on
everything: handles and spokes and carrier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and pedals&mdash;caught in them viciously, or I
fancied so. I fell over at least five times.
At last I saw the hedge, and I couldn&#8217;t
trouble to hunt for the gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There <i>is</i> no gate on my side,&#8221; the Squire
interpolated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as well I didn&#8217;t waste time, then.
I dropped the machine over somehow and
went into the road pretty near head-first;
some branch or something got my ankle
at the last moment. Anyhow, there I was
out of the wood, and seldom more thankful
or more generally sore. Then came the job
of mending my punctures. I had a good
outfit and I&#8217;m not at all bad at the business;
but this was an absolutely hopeless
case. It was seven when I got out of the
wood, and I spent fifty minutes over one
tyre. As fast as I found a hole and put
on a patch, and blew it up, it went flat
again. So I made up my mind to walk.
That hill isn&#8217;t three miles away, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more across country, but nearer
six by road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it must be. I thought I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
couldn&#8217;t have taken well over the hour over
less than five miles, even leading a bike.
Well, there&#8217;s my story: where&#8217;s yours and
Patten&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine? I&#8217;ve no story,&#8221; said the Squire.
&#8220;But you weren&#8217;t very far out when you
thought you were in a graveyard. There
must be a good few of them up there,
Patten, don&#8217;t you think? They left &#8217;em
there when they fell to bits, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patten nodded, too much interested to
speak. &#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Fanshawe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, Patten,&#8221; said the Squire,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve heard what sort of a time Mr
Fanshawe&#8217;s been having. What do you
make of it? Anything to do with Mr
Baxter? Fill yourself a glass of port,
and tell us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that done me good, Master Henry,&#8221;
said Patten, after absorbing what was before
him. &#8220;If you really wish to know what
were in my thoughts, my answer would be
clear in the affirmative. Yes,&#8221; he went on,
warming to his work, &#8220;I should say as Mr
Fanshawe&#8217;s experience of to-day were very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
largely doo to the person you named. And
I think, Master Henry, as I have some title
to speak, in view of me &#8217;aving been many
years on speaking terms with him, and
swore in to be jury on the Coroner&#8217;s inquest
near this time ten years ago, you being
then, if you carry your mind back, Master
Henry, travelling abroad, and no one &#8217;ere
to represent the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inquest?&#8221; said Fanshawe. &#8220;An inquest
on Mr Baxter, was there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, on&mdash;on that very person. The
facts as led up to that occurrence was
these. The deceased was, as you may
have gathered, a very peculiar individual in
&#8217;is &#8217;abits&mdash;in my idear, at least, but all
must speak as they find. He lived very
much to himself, without neither chick nor
child, as the saying is. And how he passed
away his time was what very few could
orfer a guess at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He lived unknown, and few could know
when Baxter ceased to be,&#8221; said the Squire
to his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon, Master Henry, I was just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
coming to that. But when I say how he
passed away his time&mdash;to be sure we know
&#8217;ow intent he was in rummaging and ransacking
out all the &#8217;istry of the neighbourhood
and the number of things he&#8217;d managed
to collect together&mdash;well, it was spoke of
for miles round as Baxter&#8217;s Museum, and
many a time when he might be in the
mood, and I might have an hour to spare,
have he showed me his pieces of pots and
what not, going back by his account to the
times of the ancient Romans. However,
you know more about that than what I do,
Master Henry: only what I was a-going to
say was this, as know what he might and
interesting as he might be in his talk,
there was something about the man&mdash;well,
for one thing, no one ever remember to see
him in church nor yet chapel at service-time.
And that made talk. Our rector
he never come in the house but once.
&#8216;Never ask me what the man said&#8217;: that
was all anybody could ever get out of <i>him</i>.
Then how did he spend his nights, particularly
about this season of the year?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Time and again the labouring men&#8217;d meet
him coming back as they went out to their
work, and he&#8217;d pass &#8217;em by without a word,
looking, they says, like someone straight out
of the asylum. They see the whites of his
eyes all round. He&#8217;d have a fish-basket
with him, that they noticed, and he always
come the same road. And the talk got to
be that he&#8217;d made himself some business,
and that not the best kind&mdash;well, not so
far from where you was at seven o&#8217;clock
this evening, sir.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, after such a night as that,
Mr Baxter he&#8217;d shut up the shop, and the
old lady that did for him had orders not to
come in; and knowing what she did about
his language, she took care to obey them
orders. But one day it so happened, about
three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, the house
being shut up as I said, there come a most
fearful to-do inside, and smoke out of the
windows, and Baxter crying out seemingly
in an agony. So the man as lived next door
he run round to the back premises and burst
the door in, and several others come too.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Well, he tell me he never in all his life
smelt such a fearful&mdash;well, odour, as what
there was in that kitchen-place. It seem
as if Baxter had been boiling something in
a pot and overset it on his leg. There he
laid on the floor, trying to keep back the
cries, but it was more than he could manage,
and when he seen the people come in&mdash;oh,
he was in a nice condition: if his tongue
warn&#8217;t blistered worse than his leg it warn&#8217;t
his fault. Well, they picked him up, and
got him into a chair, and run for the medical
man, and one of &#8217;em was going to pick up
the pot, and Baxter, he screams out to let
it alone. So he did, but he couldn&#8217;t see as
there was anything in the pot but a few
old brown bones. Then they says &#8216;Dr
Lawrence&#8217;ll be here in a minute, Mr
Baxter; he&#8217;ll soon put you to rights.&#8217; And
then he was off again. He must be got up
to his room, he couldn&#8217;t have the doctor
come in there and see all that mess&mdash;they
must throw a cloth over it&mdash;anything&mdash;the
table-cloth out of the parlour; well, so they
did. But that must have been poisonous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
stuff in that pot, for it was pretty near on
two months afore Baxter were about agin.
Beg pardon, Master Henry, was you going
to say something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I was,&#8221; said the Squire. &#8220;I wonder
you haven&#8217;t told me all this before. However,
I was going to say I remember old
Lawrence telling me he&#8217;d attended Baxter.
He was a queer card, he said. Lawrence
was up in the bedroom one day, and picked
up a little mask covered with black velvet,
and put it on in fun and went to look at
himself in the glass. He hadn&#8217;t time for
a proper look, for old Baxter shouted out
to him from the bed: &#8216;Put it down, you
fool! Do you want to look through a
dead man&#8217;s eyes?&#8217; and it startled him so
that he did put it down, and then he asked
Baxter what he meant. And Baxter insisted
on him handing it over, and said the
man he bought it from was dead, or some
such nonsense. But Lawrence felt it as he
handed it over, and he declared he was sure
it was made out of the front of a skull. He
bought a distilling apparatus at Baxter&#8217;s sale,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
he told me, but he could never use it: it
seemed to taint everything, however much
he cleaned it. But go on, Patten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Master Henry, I&#8217;m nearly done
now, and time, too, for I don&#8217;t know what
they&#8217;ll think about me in the servants&#8217; &#8217;all.
Well, this business of the scalding was some
few years before Mr Baxter was took, and
he got about again, and went on just as he&#8217;d
used. And one of the last jobs he done
was finishing up them actual glasses what
you took out last night. You see he&#8217;d made
the body of them some long time, and got
the pieces of glass for them, but there was
somethink wanted to finish &#8217;em, whatever
it was, I don&#8217;t know, but I picked up the
frame one day, and I says: &#8216;Mr Baxter,
why don&#8217;t you make a job of this?&#8217; And
he says, &#8216;Ah, when I&#8217;ve done that, you&#8217;ll
hear news, you will: there&#8217;s going to be no
such pair of glasses as mine when they&#8217;re
filled and sealed,&#8217; and there he stopped, and
I says: &#8216;Why, Mr Baxter, you talk as if
they was wine bottles: filled and sealed&mdash;why,
where&#8217;s the necessity for that?&#8217; &#8216;Did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
I say filled and sealed?&#8217; he says, &#8216;O, well,
I was suiting my conversation to my company.&#8217;
Well, then come round this time
of year, and one fine evening, I was passing
his shop on my way home, and he was
standing on the step, very pleased with
hisself, and he says: &#8216;All right and tight
now: my best bit of work&#8217;s finished, and
I&#8217;ll be out with &#8217;em to-morrow.&#8217; &#8216;What,
finished them glasses?&#8217; I says, &#8216;might I
have a look at them?&#8217; &#8216;No, no,&#8217; he says,
&#8216;I&#8217;ve put &#8217;em to bed for to-night, and when
I do show &#8217;em you, you&#8217;ll have to pay for
peepin&#8217;, so I tell you.&#8217; And that, gentlemen,
were the last words I heard that man say.</p>

<p>&#8220;That were the 17th of June, and just a
week after, there was a funny thing happened,
and it was doo to that as we brought
in &#8216;unsound mind&#8217; at the inquest, for barring
that, no one as knew Baxter in business
could anyways have laid that against him.
But George Williams, as lived in the next
house, and do now, he was woke up that
same night with a stumbling and tumbling
about in Mr Baxter&#8217;s premises, and he got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
out o&#8217; bed, and went to the front window
on the street to see if there was any rough
customers about. And it being a very light
night, he could make sure as there was not.
Then he stood and listened, and he hear
Mr Baxter coming down his front stair one
step after another very slow, and he got the
idear as it was like someone bein&#8217; pushed
or pulled down and holdin&#8217; on to everythin&#8217;
he could. Next thing he hear the street
door come open, and out come Mr Baxter
into the street in his day-clothes, &#8217;at and all,
with his arms straight down by his sides,
and talking to hisself, and shakin&#8217; his head
from one side to the other, and walking in
that peculiar way that he appeared to be
going as it were against his own will.
George Williams put up the window, and
hear him say: &#8216;O mercy, gentlemen!&#8217; and
then he shut up sudden as if, he said, someone
clapped his hand over his mouth, and
Mr Baxter threw his head back, and his hat
fell off. And Williams see his face looking
something pitiful, so as he couldn&#8217;t keep from
calling out to him: &#8216;Why, Mr Baxter, ain&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
you well?&#8217; and he was goin&#8217; to offer to fetch
Dr Lawrence to him, only he heard the
answer: &#8216;&#8217;Tis best you mind your own
business. Put in your head.&#8217; But whether
it were Mr Baxter said it so hoarse-like and
faint, he never could be sure. Still there
weren&#8217;t no one but him in the street, and
yet Williams was that upset by the way he
spoke that he shrank back from the window
and went and sat on the bed. And he
heard Mr Baxter&#8217;s step go on and up the
road, and after a minute or more he couldn&#8217;t
help but look out once more and he see him
going along the same curious way as before.
And one thing he recollected was that Mr
Baxter never stopped to pick up his &#8217;at
when it fell off, and yet there it was on his
head. Well, Master Henry, that was the
last anybody see of Mr Baxter, leastways
for a week or more. There was a lot of
people said he was called off on business, or
made off because he&#8217;d got into some scrape,
but he was well-known for miles round, and
none of the railway-people nor the public-house
people hadn&#8217;t seen him; and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
ponds was looked into and nothink found;
and at last one evening Fakes the keeper
come down from over the hill to the village,
and he says he seen the Gallows Hill
planting black with birds, and that were a
funny thing, because he never see no sign
of a creature there in his time. So they
looked at each other a bit, and first one
says: &#8216;I&#8217;m game to go up,&#8217; and another
says: &#8216;So am I, if you are,&#8217; and half a dozen
of &#8217;em set out in the evening time, and took
Dr Lawrence with them, and you know,
Master Henry, there he was between them
three stones with his neck broke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Useless to imagine the talk which this
story set going. It is not remembered.
But before Patten left them, he said to
Fanshawe: &#8220;Excuse me, sir, but did I
understand as you took out them glasses with
you to-day? I thought you did; and might
I ask, did you make use of them at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Only to look at something in a
church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed, you took &#8217;em into the
church, did you, sir?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;Yes, I did; it was Lambsfield church.
By the way, I left them strapped on to my
bicycle, I&#8217;m afraid, in the stable-yard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter for that, sir. I can bring
them in the first thing to-morrow and perhaps
you&#8217;ll be so good as to look at &#8217;em
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly, before breakfast, after a tranquil
and well-earned sleep, Fanshawe took
the glasses into the garden and directed
them to a distant hill. He lowered them
instantly, and looked at top and bottom,
worked the screws, tried them again and
yet again, shrugged his shoulders and replaced
them on the hall-table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patten,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they&#8217;re absolutely
useless. I can&#8217;t see a thing: it&#8217;s as if
someone had stuck a black wafer over the
lens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoilt my glasses, have you?&#8221; said the
Squire. &#8220;Thank you: the only ones I&#8217;ve
got.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You try them yourself,&#8221; said Fanshawe,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve done nothing to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>So after breakfast the Squire took them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
out to the terrace and stood on the steps.
After a few ineffectual attempts, &#8220;Lord, how
heavy they are!&#8221; he said impatiently, and
in the same instant dropped them on to the
stones, and the lens splintered and the barrel
cracked: a little pool of liquid formed on
the stone slab. It was inky black, and the
odour that rose from it is not to be described.</p>

<p>&#8220;Filled and sealed, eh?&#8221; said the Squire.
&#8220;If I could bring myself to touch it, I dare
say we should find the seal. So that&#8217;s what
came of his boiling and distilling, is it? Old
Ghoul!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, my good man? Remember
what he said to the doctor about
looking through dead men&#8217;s eyes? Well,
this was another way of it. But they didn&#8217;t
like having their bones boiled, I take it,
and the end of it was they carried him off
whither he would not. Well, I&#8217;ll get a
spade, and we&#8217;ll bury this thing decently.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they smoothed the turf over it, the
Squire, handing the spade to Patten, who
had been a reverential spectator, remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
to Fanshawe: &#8220;It&#8217;s almost a pity you took
that thing into the church: you might have
seen more than you did. Baxter only had
them for a week, I make out, but I don&#8217;t
see that he did much in the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; said Fanshawe, &#8220;there is
that picture of Fulnaker Priory Church.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A WARNING TO THE CURIOUS</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE place on the east coast which the
reader is asked to consider is Seaburgh.
It is not very different now from
what I remember it to have been when I
was a child. Marshes intersected by dykes
to the south, recalling the early chapters of
<i>Great Expectations</i>; flat fields to the north,
merging into heath; heath, fir woods, and,
above all, gorse, inland. A long sea-front
and a street: behind that a spacious church
of flint, with a broad, solid western tower
and a peal of six bells. How well I remember
their sound on a hot Sunday in
August, as our party went slowly up the
white, dusty slope of road towards them,
for the church stands at the top of a short,
steep incline. They rang with a flat clacking
sort of sound on those hot days, but when<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
the air was softer they were mellower too.
The railway ran down to its little terminus
farther along the same road. There was a
gay white windmill just before you came to
the station, and another down near the
shingle at the south end of the town, and
others on higher ground to the north.
There were cottages of bright red brick
with slate roofs ... but why do I encumber
you with these commonplace
details? The fact is that they come crowding
to the point of the pencil when it begins
to write of Seaburgh. I should like to be
sure that I had allowed the right ones to
get on to the paper. But I forgot. I have
not quite done with the word-painting
business yet.</p>

<p>Walk away from the sea and the town,
pass the station, and turn up the road on
the right. It is a sandy road, parallel with
the railway, and if you follow it, it climbs
to somewhat higher ground. On your left
(you are now going northward) is heath, on
your right (the side towards the sea) is a
belt of old firs, wind-beaten, thick at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
top, with the slope that old seaside trees
have; seen on the skyline from the train
they would tell you in an instant, if you did
not know it, that you were approaching a
windy coast. Well, at the top of my little
hill, a line of these firs strikes out and runs
towards the sea, for there is a ridge that
goes that way; and the ridge ends in a
rather well-defined mound commanding the
level fields of rough grass, and a little knot
of fir trees crowns it. And here you may
sit on a hot spring day, very well content
to look at blue sea, white windmills, red
cottages, bright green grass, church tower,
and distant martello tower on the south.</p>

<p>As I have said, I began to know Seaburgh
as a child; but a gap of a good many
years separates my early knowledge from
that which is more recent. Still it keeps its
place in my affections, and any tales of it
that I pick up have an interest for me.
One such tale is this: it came to me in a
place very remote from Seaburgh, and quite
accidentally, from a man whom I had been
able to oblige&mdash;enough in his opinion to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
justify his making me his confidant to this
extent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I know all that country more or less, (he
said). I used to go to Seaburgh pretty
regularly for golf in the spring. I generally
put up at the &#8220;Bear,&#8221; with a friend&mdash;Henry
Long it was, you knew him perhaps&mdash;(&#8220;Slightly,&#8221;
I said) and we used to take a sitting-room
and be very happy there. Since he
died I haven&#8217;t cared to go there. And I don&#8217;t
know that I should anyhow after the particular
thing that happened on our last visit.</p>

<p>It was in April, 19&mdash;, we were there, and
by some chance we were almost the only
people in the hotel. So the ordinary public
rooms were practically empty, and we were
the more surprised when, after dinner, our
sitting-room door opened, and a young man
put his head in. We were aware of this
young man. He was rather a rabbity
an&aelig;mic subject&mdash;light hair and light eyes&mdash;but
not unpleasing. So when he said: &#8220;I
beg your pardon, is this a private room?&#8221;
we did not growl and say: &#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
but Long said, or I did&mdash;no matter which:
&#8220;Please come in.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, may I?&#8221; he said,
and seemed relieved. Of course it was
obvious that he wanted company; and as
he was a reasonable kind of person&mdash;not
the sort to bestow his whole family history
on you&mdash;we urged him to make himself at
home. &#8220;I dare say you find the other rooms
rather bleak,&#8221; I said. Yes, he did: but it
was really too good of us, and so on. That
being got over, he made some pretence
of reading a book. Long was playing
Patience, I was writing. It became plain
to me after a few minutes that this visitor
of ours was in rather a state of fidgets or
nerves, which communicated itself to me,
and so I put away my writing and turned
to at engaging him in talk.</p>

<p>After some remarks, which I forget, he
became rather confidential. &#8220;You&#8217;ll think
it very odd of me,&#8221; (this was the sort of
way he began), &#8220;but the fact is I&#8217;ve had
something of a shock.&#8221; Well, I recommended
a drink of some cheering kind, and
we had it. The waiter coming in made an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
interruption (and I thought our young man
seemed very jumpy when the door opened),
but after a while he got back to his woes
again. There was nobody he knew in the
place, and he did happen to know who we
both were (it turned out there was some
common acquaintance in town), and really
he did want a word of advice, if we didn&#8217;t
mind. Of course we both said: &#8220;By all
means,&#8221; or &#8220;Not at all,&#8221; and Long put away
his cards. And we settled down to hear
what his difficulty was.</p>

<p>&#8220;It began,&#8221; he said, &#8220;more than a week
ago, when I bicycled over to Froston, only
about five or six miles, to see the church&mdash;I&#8217;m
very much interested in architecture,
and it&#8217;s got one of those pretty porches
with niches and shields. I took a photograph
of it, and then an old man who was
tidying up in the churchyard came and
asked if I&#8217;d care to look into the church.
I said yes, and he produced a key and let
me in. There wasn&#8217;t much inside, but I
told him it was a nice little church, and he
kept it very clean, &#8216;but,&#8217; I said, &#8216;the porch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
is the best part of it.&#8217; We were just outside
the porch then, and he said, &#8216;Ah, yes, that
is a nice porch; and do you know, sir, what&#8217;s
the meanin&#8217; of that coat of arms there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the one with the three crowns,
and though I&#8217;m not much of a herald, I
was able to say yes, I thought it was the
old arms of the kingdom of East Anglia.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s right, sir,&#8217; he said, &#8216;and do you
know the meanin&#8217; of them three crowns
that&#8217;s on it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I&#8217;d no doubt it was known, but
I couldn&#8217;t recollect to have heard it myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, then,&#8217; he said, &#8216;for all you&#8217;re a
scholard, I can tell you something you don&#8217;t
know. Them&#8217;s the three &#8217;oly crowns what
was buried in the ground near by the coast
to keep the Germans from landing&mdash;ah, I
can see you don&#8217;t believe that. But I tell
you, if it hadn&#8217;t have been for one of them
&#8217;oly crowns bein&#8217; there still, them Germans
would a landed here time and again, they
would. Landed with their ships, and killed
man, woman and child in their beds. Now
then, that&#8217;s the truth what I&#8217;m telling you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
that is; and if you don&#8217;t believe me, you
ast the rector. There he comes: you ast
him, I says.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I looked round, and there was the
rector, a nice-looking old man, coming up
the path; and before I could begin assuring
my old man, who was getting quite excited,
that I didn&#8217;t disbelieve him, the rector
struck in, and said: &#8216;What&#8217;s all this about,
John? Good-day to you, sir. Have you
been looking at our little church?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So then there was a little talk which
allowed the old man to calm down, and
then the rector asked him again what was
the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; he said, &#8216;it warn&#8217;t nothink, only I
was telling this gentleman he&#8217;d ought to
ast you about them &#8217;oly crowns.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah, yes, to be sure,&#8217; said the rector,
&#8216;that&#8217;s a very curious matter, isn&#8217;t it? But
I don&#8217;t know whether the gentleman is
interested in our old stories, eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, he&#8217;ll be interested fast enough,&#8217;
says the old man, &#8216;he&#8217;ll put his confidence
in what you tells him, sir; why, you known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
William Ager yourself, father and son too.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I put in a word to say how much
I should like to hear all about it, and before
many minutes I was walking up the village
street with the rector who had one or two
words to say to parishioners, and then to
the rectory, where he took me into his
study. He had made out, on the way, that
I really was capable of taking an intelligent
interest in a piece of folklore and not quite
the ordinary tripper. So he was very willing
to talk, and it is rather surprising to me that
the particular legend he told me has not
made its way into print before. His account
of it was this: &#8216;There has always been a
belief in these parts in the three holy crowns.
The old people say they were buried in
different places near the coast to keep off
the Danes or the French or the Germans.
And they say that one of the three was dug
up a long time ago, and another has disappeared
by the encroaching of the sea, and
one&#8217;s still left doing its work, keeping off
invaders. Well, now, if you have read the
ordinary guides and histories of this county,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
you will remember perhaps that in 1687 a
crown, which was said to be the crown of
Redwald, King of the East Angles, was
dug up at Rendlesham, and alas! alas!
melted down before it was even properly
described or drawn. Well, Rendlesham
isn&#8217;t on the coast, but it isn&#8217;t so very far
inland, and it&#8217;s on a very important line of
access. And I believe that is the crown
which the people mean when they say that
one has been dug up. Then on the south
you don&#8217;t want me to tell you where there
was a Saxon royal palace which is now
under the sea, eh? Well, there was the
second crown, I take it. And between
these two, they say, lies the third.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do they say where it is?&#8217; of course I
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;Yes, indeed, they do, but
they don&#8217;t tell,&#8217; and his manner did not
encourage me to put the obvious question.
Instead of that I waited a moment, and
said: &#8216;What did the old man mean when
he said you knew William Ager, as if that
had something to do with the crowns?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;&#8216;To be sure,&#8217; he said, &#8216;now that&#8217;s
another curious story. These Agers&mdash;it&#8217;s a
very old name in these parts, but I can&#8217;t
find that they were ever people of quality
or big owners&mdash;these Agers say, or said,
that their branch of the family were the
guardians of the last crown. A certain old
Nathaniel Ager was the first one I knew&mdash;I
was born and brought up quite near here&mdash;and
he, I believe, camped out at the
place during the whole of the war of 1870.
William, his son, did the same, I know,
during the South African War. And young
William, <i>his</i> son, who has only died fairly
recently, took lodgings at the cottage
nearest the spot, and I&#8217;ve no doubt hastened
his end, for he was a consumptive, by exposure
and night watching. And he was
the last of that branch. It was a dreadful
grief to him to think that he was the last,
but he could do nothing, the only relations
at all near to him were in the colonies.
I wrote letters for him to them imploring
them to come over on business very important
to the family, but there has been no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
answer. So the last of the holy crowns, if
it&#8217;s there, has no guardian now.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was what the rector told me, and
you can fancy how interesting I found it.
The only thing I could think of when I left
him was how to hit upon the spot where
the crown was supposed to be. I wish I&#8217;d
left it alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there was a sort of fate in it, for as
I bicycled back past the churchyard wall
my eye caught a fairly new gravestone, and
on it was the name of William Ager. Of
course I got off and read it. It said &#8216;of
this parish, died at Seaburgh, 19&mdash;, aged 28.&#8217;
There it was, you see. A little judicious
questioning in the right place, and I should
at least find the cottage nearest the spot.
Only I didn&#8217;t quite know what was the
right spot to begin my questioning at.
Again there was fate: it took me to the
curiosity-shop down that way&mdash;you know&mdash;and
I turned over some old books, and, if
you please, one was a prayer-book of 1740
odd, in a rather handsome binding&mdash;I&#8217;ll just
go and get it, it&#8217;s in my room.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>He left us in a state of some surprise, but
we had hardly time to exchange any
remarks when he was back, panting, and
handed us the book opened at the fly-leaf,
on which was, in a straggly hand:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Nathaniel Ager is my name and England is my nation,</div>
<div class="verse">Seaburgh is my dwelling-place and Christ is my Salvation,</div>
<div class="verse">When I am dead and in my Grave, and all my bones are rotton,</div>
<div class="verse">I hope the Lord will think on me when I am quite forgotton.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>This poem was dated 1754, and there
were many more entries of Agers, Nathaniel,
Frederick, William, and so on, ending with
William, 19&mdash;.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he said, &#8220;anybody would call
it the greatest bit of luck. <i>I</i> did, but I
don&#8217;t now. Of course I asked the shopman
about William Ager, and of course he
happened to remember that he lodged in a
cottage in the North Field and died there.
This was just chalking the road for me. I
knew which the cottage must be: there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
only one sizable one about there. The
next thing was to scrape some sort of
acquaintance with the people, and I took
a walk that way at once. A dog did the
business for me: he made at me so fiercely
that they had to run out and beat him off,
and then naturally begged my pardon, and
we got into talk. I had only to bring up
Ager&#8217;s name, and pretend I knew, or
thought I knew something of him, and
then the woman said how sad it was him
dying so young, and she was sure it came
of him spending the night out of doors in
the cold weather. Then I had to say: &#8216;Did
he go out on the sea at night?&#8217; and she
said: &#8216;Oh, no, it was on the hillock yonder
with the trees on it.&#8217; And there I was.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know something about digging in these
barrows: I&#8217;ve opened many of them in the
down country. But that was with owner&#8217;s
leave, and in broad daylight and with men
to help. I had to prospect very carefully
here before I put a spade in: I couldn&#8217;t
trench across the mound, and with those
old firs growing there I knew there would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
be awkward tree roots. Still the soil was
very light and sandy and easy, and there
was a rabbit hole or so that might be developed
into a sort of tunnel. The going
out and coming back at odd hours to the
hotel was going to be the awkward part.
When I made up my mind about the way
to excavate I told the people that I was
called away for a night, and I spent it out
there. I made my tunnel: I won&#8217;t bore
you with the details of how I supported it
and filled it in when I&#8217;d done, but the main
thing is that I got the crown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally we both broke out into exclamations
of surprise and interest. I for
one had long known about the finding of
the crown at Rendlesham and had often
lamented its fate. No one has ever seen an
Anglo-Saxon crown&mdash;at least no one had.
But our man gazed at us with a rueful eye.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the worst of it is I
don&#8217;t know how to put it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it back?&#8221; we cried out. &#8220;Why,
my dear sir, you&#8217;ve made one of the most
exciting finds ever heard of in this country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Of course it ought to go to the Jewel
House at the Tower. What&#8217;s your difficulty?
If you&#8217;re thinking about the
owner of the land, and treasure-trove, and
all that, we can certainly help you through.
Nobody&#8217;s going to make a fuss about
technicalities in a case of this kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably more was said, but all he did
was to put his face in his hands, and mutter:
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to put it back.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last Long said: &#8220;You&#8217;ll forgive me,
I hope, if I seem impertinent, but are you
<i>quite</i> sure you&#8217;ve got it?&#8221; I was wanting
to ask much the same question myself, for
of course the story did seem a lunatic&#8217;s
dream when one thought over it. But I
hadn&#8217;t quite dared to say what might hurt
the poor young man&#8217;s feelings. However
he took it quite calmly&mdash;really, with the
calm of despair, you might say. He sat up
and said: &#8220;Oh yes, there&#8217;s no doubt of
that: I have it here, in my room, locked up
in my bag. You can come and look at it if
you like: I won&#8217;t offer to bring it here.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were not likely to let the chance slip.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
We went with him; his room was only a
few doors off. The boots was just collecting
shoes in the passage: or so we thought:
afterwards we were not sure. Our visitor&mdash;his
name was Paxton&mdash;was in a worse state
of shivers than before, and went hurriedly
into the room, and beckoned us after him,
turned on the light, and shut the door carefully.
Then he unlocked his kit-bag, and
produced a bundle of clean pocket-handkerchiefs
in which something was wrapped, laid
it on the bed, and undid it. I can now say
I <i>have</i> seen an actual Anglo-Saxon crown.
It was of silver&mdash;as the Rendlesham one is
always said to have been&mdash;it was set with
some gems, mostly antique intaglios and
cameos, and was of rather plain, almost
rough workmanship. In fact, it was like
those you see on the coins and in the manuscripts.
I found no reason to think it was
later than the ninth century. I was intensely
interested, of course, and I wanted
to turn it over in my hands, but Paxton
prevented me. &#8220;Don&#8217;t <i>you</i> touch it,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221; And with a sigh that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
was, I declare to you, dreadful to hear, he
took it up and turned it about so that we
could see every part of it. &#8220;Seen enough?&#8221;
he said at last, and we nodded. He wrapped
it up and locked it in his bag, and stood
looking at us dumbly. &#8220;Come back to our
room,&#8221; Long said, &#8220;and tell us what the
trouble is.&#8221; He thanked us, and said:
&#8220;Will you go first and see if&mdash;if the coast
is clear?&#8221; That wasn&#8217;t very intelligible,
for our proceedings hadn&#8217;t been, after all,
very suspicious, and the hotel, as I said,
was practically empty. However, we were
beginning to have inklings of&mdash;we didn&#8217;t
know what, and anyhow nerves are infectious.
So we did go, first peering out as
we opened the door, and fancying (I found
we both had the fancy) that a shadow, or
more than a shadow&mdash;but it made no sound&mdash;passed
from before us to one side as we
came out into the passage. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221;
we whispered to Paxton&mdash;whispering seemed
the proper tone&mdash;and we went, with him
between us, back to our sitting-room. I
was preparing, when we got there, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
ecstatic about the unique interest of what
we had seen, but when I looked at Paxton
I saw that would be terribly out of place,
and I left it to him to begin.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> to be done?&#8221; was his opening.
Long thought it right (as he explained to
me afterwards) to be obtuse, and said:
&#8220;Why not find out who the owner of the
land is, and inform&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; &#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221;
Paxton broke in impatiently, &#8220;I beg your
pardon: you&#8217;ve been very kind, but don&#8217;t
you see it&#8217;s <i>got</i> to go back, and I daren&#8217;t be
there at night, and daytime&#8217;s impossible.
Perhaps, though, you don&#8217;t see: well, then,
the truth is that I&#8217;ve never been alone since
I touched it.&#8221; I was beginning some fairly
stupid comment, but Long caught my eye,
and I stopped. Long said: &#8220;I think I
do see, perhaps: but wouldn&#8217;t it be&mdash;a relief&mdash;to
tell us a little more clearly what the
situation is?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it all came out: Paxton looked over
his shoulder and beckoned to us to come
nearer to him, and began speaking in a low
voice: we listened most intently, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
and compared notes afterwards, and I wrote
down our version, so I am confident I have
what he told us almost word for word. He
said: &#8220;It began when I was first prospecting,
and put me off again and again. There
was always somebody&mdash;a man&mdash;standing by
one of the firs. This was in daylight, you
know. He was never in front of me. I
always saw him with the tail of my eye on
the left or the right, and he was never there
when I looked straight for him. I would
lie down for quite a long time and take
careful observations, and make sure there
was no one, and then when I got up and
began prospecting again, there he was. And
he began to give me hints, besides; for
wherever I put that prayer-book&mdash;short of
locking it up, which I did at last&mdash;when I
came back to my room it was always out
on my table open at the fly-leaf where the
names are, and one of my razors across it to
keep it open. I&#8217;m sure he just can&#8217;t open
my bag, or something more would have
happened. You see, he&#8217;s light and weak,
but all the same I daren&#8217;t face him. Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
then, when I was making the tunnel, of
course it was worse, and if I hadn&#8217;t been so
keen I should have dropped the whole thing
and run. It was like someone scraping at
my back all the time: I thought for a long
time it was only soil dropping on me, but
as I got nearer the&mdash;the crown, it was unmistakable.
And when I actually laid it
bare and got my fingers into the ring of
it and pulled it out, there came a sort of
cry behind me&mdash;Oh, I can&#8217;t tell you how
desolate it was! And horribly threatening
too. It spoilt all my pleasure in my find&mdash;cut
it off that moment. And if I hadn&#8217;t
been the wretched fool I am, I should have
put the thing back and left it. But I didn&#8217;t.
The rest of the time was just awful. I had
hours to get through before I could decently
come back to the hotel. First I spent time
filling up my tunnel and covering my tracks,
and all the while he was there trying to
thwart me. Sometimes, you know, you see
him, and sometimes you don&#8217;t, just as he
pleases, I think: he&#8217;s there, but he has some
power over your eyes. Well, I wasn&#8217;t off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the spot very long before sunrise, and then
I had to get to the junction for Seaburgh,
and take a train back. And though it was
daylight fairly soon, I don&#8217;t know if that
made it much better. There were always
hedges, or gorse-bushes, or park fences along
the road&mdash;some sort of cover, I mean&mdash;and
I was never easy for a second. And then
when I began to meet people going to
work, they always looked behind me very
strangely: it might have been that they
were surprised at seeing anyone so early;
but I didn&#8217;t think it was only that, and I
don&#8217;t now: they didn&#8217;t look exactly at <i>me</i>.
And the porter at the train was like that
too. And the guard held open the door
after I&#8217;d got into the carriage&mdash;just as he
would if there was somebody else coming,
you know. Oh, you may be very sure it
isn&#8217;t my fancy,&#8221; he said with a dull sort of
laugh. Then he went on: &#8220;And even if
I do get it put back, he won&#8217;t forgive me:
I can tell that. And I was so happy a
fortnight ago.&#8221; He dropped into a chair,
and I believe he began to cry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>We didn&#8217;t know what to say, but we
felt we must come to the rescue somehow,
and so&mdash;it really seemed the only thing,&mdash;we
said if he was so set on putting the crown
back in its place, we would help him. And
I must say that after what we had heard
it did seem the right thing. If these horrid
consequences had come on this poor man,
might there not really be something in the
original idea of the crown having some
curious power bound up with it, to guard
the coast? At least, that was my feeling,
and I think it was Long&#8217;s too. Our offer
was very welcome to Paxton, anyhow.
When could we do it? It was nearing
half-past ten. Could we contrive to make
a late walk plausible to the hotel people
that very night? We looked out of the
window: there was a brilliant full moon&mdash;the
Paschal moon. Long undertook to
tackle the boots and propitiate him. He
was to say that we should not be much over
the hour, and if we did find it so pleasant
that we stopped out a bit longer we would
see that he didn&#8217;t lose by sitting up. Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
we were pretty regular customers of the
hotel, and did not give much trouble, and
were considered by the servants to be not
under the mark in the way of tips; and so
the boots <i>was</i> propitiated, and let us out on
to the sea-front, and remained, as we heard
later, looking after us. Paxton had a large
coat over his arm, under which was the
wrapped-up crown.</p>

<p>So we were off on this strange errand
before we had time to think how very much
out of the way it was. I have told this
part quite shortly on purpose, for it really
does represent the haste with which we
settled our plan and took action. &#8220;The
shortest way is up the hill and through the
churchyard,&#8221; Paxton said, as we stood a
moment before the hotel looking up and
down the front. There was nobody about&mdash;nobody
at all. Seaburgh out of the season
is an early, quiet place. &#8220;We can&#8217;t go
along the dyke by the cottage, because of
the dog,&#8221; Paxton also said, when I pointed
to what I thought a shorter way along the
front and across two fields. The reason he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
gave was good enough. We went up the
road to the church, and turned in at the
churchyard gate. I confess to having
thought that there might be some lying
there who might be conscious of our
business: but if it was so, they were also
conscious that one who was on their side, so
to say, had us under surveillance, and we
saw no sign of them. But under observation
we felt we were, as I have never felt it
at another time. Specially was it so when
we passed out of the churchyard into a
narrow path with close high hedges, through
which we hurried as Christian did through
that Valley; and so got out into open fields.
Then along hedges, though I would sooner
have been in the open, where I could see if
anyone was visible behind me; over a gate or
two, and then a swerve to the left, taking
us up on to the ridge which ended in that
mound.</p>

<p>As we neared it, Henry Long felt, and I
felt too, that there were what I can only
call dim presences waiting for us, as well
as a far more actual one attending us. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Paxton&#8217;s agitation all this time I can give
you no adequate picture: he breathed like a
hunted beast, and we could not either of us
look at his face. How he would manage
when we got to the very place we had not
troubled to think: he had seemed so sure
that that would not be difficult. Nor was
it. I never saw anything like the dash with
which he flung himself at a particular spot
in the side of the mound, and tore at it, so
that in a very few minutes the greater part
of his body was out of sight. We stood
holding the coat and that bundle of handkerchiefs,
and looking, very fearfully, I must
admit, about us. There was nothing to be
seen: a line of dark firs behind us made
one skyline, more trees and the church
tower half-a-mile off on the right, cottages
and a windmill on the horizon on the left,
calm sea dead in front, faint barking of
a dog at a cottage on a gleaming dyke
between us and it: full moon making that
path we know across the sea: the eternal
whisper of the Scotch firs just above us and
of the sea in front. Yet, in all this quiet, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
acute, an acrid consciousness of a restrained
hostility very near us, like a dog on a leash
that might be let go at any moment.</p>

<p>Paxton pulled himself out of the hole,
and stretched a hand back to us. &#8220;Give it
to me,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;unwrapped.&#8221; We
pulled off the handkerchiefs, and he took the
crown. The moonlight just fell on it as he
snatched it. We had not ourselves touched
that bit of metal, and I have thought since
that it was just as well. In another moment
Paxton was out of the hole again and busy
shovelling back the soil with hands that
were already bleeding. He would have
none of our help, though. It was much the
longest part of the job to get the place to look
undisturbed: yet&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how&mdash;he
made a wonderful success of it. At last he
was satisfied, and we turned back.</p>

<p>We were a couple of hundred yards from
the hill when Long suddenly said to him:
&#8220;I say, you&#8217;ve left your coat there. That
won&#8217;t do. See?&#8221; And I certainly did see
it&mdash;the long dark overcoat lying where the
tunnel had been. Paxton had not stopped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
however: he only shook his head, and held
up the coat on his arm. And when we
joined him, he said, without any excitement,
but as if nothing mattered any more:
&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t my coat.&#8221; And, indeed, when
we looked back again, that dark thing was
not to be seen.</p>

<p>Well, we got out on to the road, and
came rapidly back that way. It was well
before twelve when we got in, trying to put
a good face on it, and saying&mdash;Long and I&mdash;what
a lovely night it was for a walk.
The boots was on the lookout for us, and
we made remarks like that for his edification
as we entered the hotel. He gave another
look up and down the sea-front before he
locked the front door, and said: &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t meet many people about, I s&#8217;pose,
sir?&#8221; &#8220;No, indeed, not a soul,&#8221; I said; at
which I remember Paxton looked oddly at
me. &#8220;Only I thought I see someone turn
up the station road after you gentlemen,&#8221;
said the boots. &#8220;Still, you was three together,
and I don&#8217;t suppose he meant
mischief.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know what to say;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Long merely said &#8220;Good-night,&#8221; and we
went off upstairs, promising to turn out all
lights, and to go to bed in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Back in our room, we did our very best
to make Paxton take a cheerful view.
&#8220;There&#8217;s the crown safe back,&#8221; we said,
&#8220;very likely you&#8217;d have done better not
to touch it&#8221; (and he heavily assented to
that), &#8220;but no real harm has been done,
and we shall never give this away to anyone
who would be so mad as to go near it.
Besides, don&#8217;t you feel better yourself? I
don&#8217;t mind confessing,&#8221; I said, &#8220;that on the
way there I was very much inclined to take
your view about&mdash;well, about being followed;
but going back, it wasn&#8217;t at all the
same thing, was it?&#8221; No, it wouldn&#8217;t do:
&#8220;<i>You&#8217;ve</i> nothing to trouble yourselves
about,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I&#8217;m not forgiven. I&#8217;ve
got to pay for that miserable sacrilege still.
I know what you are going to say. The
Church might help. Yes, but it&#8217;s the body
that has to suffer. It&#8217;s true I&#8217;m not feeling
that he&#8217;s waiting outside for me just now.
But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; then he stopped. Then he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
to thanking us, and we put him off as soon
as we could. And naturally we pressed
him to use our sitting-room next day, and
said we should be glad to go out with him.
Or did he play golf, perhaps? Yes, he did,
but he didn&#8217;t think he should care about
that to-morrow. Well, we recommended
him to get up late and sit in our room in
the morning while we were playing, and we
would have a walk later in the day. He
was very submissive and <i>piano</i> about it all:
ready to do just what we thought best, but
clearly quite certain in his own mind that
what was coming could not be averted or
palliated. You&#8217;ll wonder why we didn&#8217;t
insist on accompanying him to his home
and seeing him safe into the care of brothers
or someone. The fact was he had nobody.
He had had a flat in town, but lately he
had made up his mind to settle for a time in
Sweden, and he had dismantled his flat and
shipped off his belongings, and was whiling
away a fortnight or three weeks before he
made a start. Anyhow we didn&#8217;t see what
we could do better than sleep on it&mdash;or not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
sleep very much, as was my case&mdash;and see
what we felt like to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>We felt very different, Long and I, on as
beautiful an April morning as you could
desire; and Paxton also looked very different
when we saw him at breakfast.
&#8220;The first approach to a decent night I
seem ever to have had,&#8221; was what he said.
But he was going to do as we had settled:
stay in probably all the morning, and come
out with us later. We went to the links;
we met some other men and played with
them in the morning, and had lunch there
rather early, so as not to be late back. All
the same, the snares of death overtook him.</p>

<p>Whether it could have been prevented, I
don&#8217;t know. I think he would have been
got at somehow, do what we might. Anyhow,
this is what happened.</p>

<p>We went straight up to our room. Paxton
was there, reading quite peaceably. &#8220;Ready
to come out shortly?&#8221; said Long, &#8220;say in
half-an-hour&#8217;s time?&#8221; &#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he said:
and I said we would change first, and
perhaps have baths, and call for him in half-an-hour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
I had my bath first, and went
and lay down on my bed, and slept for
about ten minutes. We came out of our
rooms at the same time, and went together
to the sitting-room. Paxton wasn&#8217;t there&mdash;only
his book. Nor was he in his room,
nor in the downstair rooms. We shouted
for him. A servant came out and said:
&#8220;Why, I thought you gentlemen was gone
out already, and so did the other gentleman.
He heard you a-calling from the path there,
and run out in a hurry, and I looked out of
the coffee-room window, but I didn&#8217;t see
you. &#8217;Owever, he run off down the beach
that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word we ran that way too&mdash;it
was the opposite direction to that of last
night&#8217;s expedition. It wasn&#8217;t quite four
o&#8217;clock, and the day was fair, though not so
fair as it had been, so there was really no
reason, you&#8217;d say, for anxiety: with people
about, surely a man couldn&#8217;t come to much
harm.</p>

<p>But something in our look as we ran out
must have struck the servant, for she came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
out on the steps, and pointed, and said,
&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the way he went.&#8221; We ran on
as far as the top of the shingle bank, and
there pulled up. There was a choice of
ways: past the houses on the sea-front, or
along the sand at the bottom of the beach,
which, the tide being now out, was fairly
broad. Or of course we might keep along
the shingle between these two tracks and
have some view of both of them; only that
was heavy going. We chose the sand, for
that was the loneliest, and someone <i>might</i>
come to harm there without being seen
from the public path.</p>

<p>Long said he saw Paxton some distance
ahead, running and waving his stick, as if
he wanted to signal to people who were on
ahead of him. I couldn&#8217;t be sure: one of
these sea-mists was coming up very quickly
from the south. There was someone, that&#8217;s
all I could say. And there were tracks on
the sand as of someone running who wore
shoes; and there were other tracks made
before those&mdash;for the shoes sometimes trod
in them and interfered with them&mdash;of someone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
not in shoes. Oh, of course, it&#8217;s only my
word you&#8217;ve got to take for all this: Long&#8217;s
dead. We&#8217;d no time or means to make
sketches or take casts, and the next tide
washed everything away. All we could do
was to notice these marks as we hurried on.
But there they were over and over again,
and we had no doubt whatever that what
we saw was the track of a bare foot, and
one that showed more bones than flesh.</p>

<p>The notion of Paxton running after&mdash;after
anything like this, and supposing it to
be the friends he was looking for, was very
dreadful to us. You can guess what we
fancied: how the thing he was following
might stop suddenly and turn round on
him, and what sort of face it would show,
half-seen at first in the mist&mdash;which all the
while was getting thicker and thicker. And
as I ran on wondering how the poor wretch
could have been lured into mistaking that
other thing for us, I remembered his saying,
&#8220;He has some power over your eyes.&#8221; And
then I wondered what the end would be,
for I had no hope now that the end could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
be averted, and&mdash;well, there is no need to
tell all the dismal and horrid thoughts that
flitted through my head as we ran on into
the mist. It was uncanny, too, that the
sun should still be bright in the sky and we
could see nothing. We could only tell that
we were now past the houses and had
reached that gap there is between them
and the old martello tower. When you
are past the tower, you know, there is
nothing but shingle for a long way&mdash;not a
house, not a human creature, just that spit
of land, or rather shingle, with the river on
your right and the sea on your left.</p>

<p>But just before that, just by the martello
tower, you remember there is the old
battery, close to the sea. I believe there
are only a few blocks of concrete left now:
the rest has all been washed away, but at
this time there was a lot more, though the
place was a ruin. Well, when we got there,
we clambered to the top as quick as we could
to take breath and look over the shingle in
front if by chance the mist would let us see
anything. But a moment&#8217;s rest we must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
have. We had run a mile at least. Nothing
whatever was visible ahead of us, and we
were just turning by common consent to
get down and run hopelessly on, when we
heard what I can only call a laugh: and
if you can understand what I mean by a
breathless, a lungless laugh, you have it;
but I don&#8217;t suppose you can. It came from
below, and swerved away into the mist.
That was enough. We bent over the wall.
Paxton was there at the bottom.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to be told that he was
dead. His tracks showed that he had run
along the side of the battery, had turned
sharp round the corner of it, and, small
doubt of it, must have dashed straight into
the open arms of someone who was waiting
there. His mouth was full of sand and
stones, and his teeth and jaws were broken
to bits. I only glanced once at his face.</p>

<p>At the same moment, just as we were
scrambling down from the battery to get to
the body, we heard a shout, and saw a man
running down the bank of the martello
tower. He was the caretaker stationed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
there, and his keen old eyes had managed
to descry through the mist that something
was wrong. He had seen Paxton fall, and
had seen us a moment after, running up&mdash;fortunate
this, for otherwise we could hardly
have escaped suspicion of being concerned
in the dreadful business. Had he, we asked,
caught sight of anybody attacking our friend?
He could not be sure.</p>

<p>We sent him off for help, and stayed by
the dead man till they came with the
stretcher. It was then that we traced out
how he had come, on the narrow fringe of
sand under the battery wall. The rest was
shingle, and it was hopelessly impossible to
tell whither the other had gone.</p>

<p>What were we to say at the inquest? It
was a duty, we felt, not to give up, there
and then, the secret of the crown, to be
published in every paper. I don&#8217;t know
how much you would have told; but what
we did agree upon was this: to say that we
had only made acquaintance with Paxton
the day before, and that he had told us he
was under some apprehension of danger at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
the hands of a man called William Ager.
Also that we had seen some other tracks
besides Paxton&#8217;s when we followed him
along the beach. But of course by that
time everything was gone from the sands.</p>

<p>No one had any knowledge, fortunately,
of any William Ager living in the district.
The evidence of the man at the martello
tower freed us from all suspicion. All that
could be done was to return a verdict of
wilful murder by some person or persons
unknown.</p>

<p>Paxton was so totally without connections
that all the enquiries that were subsequently
made ended in a No Thoroughfare. And I
have never been at Seaburgh, or even near
it, since.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN EVENING&#8217;S ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">NOTHING is more common form in old-fashioned
books than the description of
the winter fireside, where the aged grandam
narrates to the circle of children that hangs
on her lips story after story of ghosts and
fairies, and inspires her audience with a pleasing
terror. But we are never allowed to
know what the stories were. We hear,
indeed, of sheeted spectres with saucer eyes,
and&mdash;still more intriguing&mdash;of &#8220;Rawhead
and Bloody Bones&#8221; (an expression which the
Oxford Dictionary traces back to 1550), but
the context of these striking images eludes us.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a problem which has long
obsessed me; but I see no means of solving
it finally. The aged grandams are gone, and
the collectors of folklore began their work
in England too late to save most of the
actual stories which the grandams told. Yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
such things do not easily die quite out, and
imagination, working on scattered hints, may
be able to devise a picture of an evening&#8217;s
entertainment, such an one as Mrs Marcet&#8217;s
<i>Evening Conversations</i>, Mr Joyce&#8217;s <i>Dialogues
on Chemistry</i>, and somebody else&#8217;s <i>Philosophy
in Sport made Science in Earnest</i>,
aimed at extinguishing by substituting for
Error and Superstition the light of Utility
and Truth; in some such terms as these:</p>

<p><i>Charles</i>: I think, papa, that I now understand
the properties of the lever, which you
so kindly explained to me on Saturday; but
I have been very much puzzled since then
in thinking about the pendulum, and have
wondered why it is that, when you stop it,
the clock does not go on any more.</p>

<p><i>Papa</i>: (You young sinner, have you been
meddling with the clock in the hall? Come
here to me! <i>No, this must be a gloss that
has somehow crept into the text</i>). Well, my
boy, though I do not wholly approve of
your conducting without my supervision
experiments which may possibly impair the
usefulness of a valuable scientific instrument,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
I will do my best to explain the principles of
the pendulum to you. Fetch me a piece of
stout whipcord from the drawer in my study,
and ask cook to be so good as to lend you
one of the weights which she uses in her
kitchen.</p>

<p>And so we are off.</p>

<p>How different the scene in a household
to which the beams of Science have not yet
penetrated! The Squire, exhausted by a
long day after the partridges, and replete
with food and drink, is snoring on one side of
the fireplace. His old mother sits opposite to
him knitting, and the children (Charles and
Lucy, not Harry and Lucy: they would never
have stood it) are gathered about her knee.</p>

<p><i>Grandmother</i>: Now, my dears, you must
be very good and quiet, or you&#8217;ll wake your
father, and you know what&#8217;ll happen then.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i>: Yes, I know: he&#8217;ll be woundy
cross-tempered and send us off to bed.</p>

<p><i>Grandmother</i> (<i>stops knitting and speaks
with severity</i>): What&#8217;s that? Fie upon you,
Charles! that&#8217;s not a way to speak. Now I
<i>was</i> going to have told you a story, but if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
use such-like words, I shan&#8217;t. (<i>Suppressed
outcry</i>: &#8220;Oh, granny!&#8221;) Hush! hush!
Now I believe you <i>have</i> woke your father!</p>

<p><i>Squire</i> (<i>thickly</i>): Look here, mother, if you
can&#8217;t keep them brats quiet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Grandmother</i>: Yes, John, yes! it&#8217;s too
bad. I&#8217;ve been telling them if it happens
again, off to bed they shall go.</p>

<p><i>Squire</i> relapses.</p>

<p><i>Grandmother</i>: There, now, you see,
children, what did I tell you? you <i>must</i> be
good and sit still. And I&#8217;ll tell you what:
to-morrow you shall go a-blackberrying, and
if you bring home a nice basketful, I&#8217;ll make
you some jam.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i>: Oh yes, granny, do! and I know
where the best blackberries are: I saw &#8217;em
to-day.</p>

<p><i>Grandmother</i>: And where&#8217;s that, Charles?</p>

<p><i>Charles</i>: Why, in the little lane that goes
up past Collins&#8217;s cottage.</p>

<p><i>Grandmother</i> (<i>laying down her knitting</i>):
Charles! whatever you do, don&#8217;t you dare
to pick one single blackberry in that lane.
Don&#8217;t you <i>know</i>&mdash;but there, how should you&mdash;what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
was I thinking of? Well, anyway,
you mind what I say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles and Lucy</i>: But why, granny?
Why shouldn&#8217;t we pick &#8217;em there?</p>

<p><i>Grandmother</i>: Hush! hush! Very well
then, I&#8217;ll tell you all about it, only you
mustn&#8217;t interrupt. Now let me see. When
I was quite a little girl that lane had a bad
name, though it seems people don&#8217;t remember
about it now. And one day&mdash;dear me, just
as it might be to-night&mdash;I told my poor
mother when I came home to my supper&mdash;a
summer evening it was&mdash;I told her where
I&#8217;d been for my walk, and how I&#8217;d come
back down that lane, and I asked her how it
was that there were currant and gooseberry
bushes growing in a little patch at the top
of the lane. And oh, dear me, such a taking
as she was in! She shook me and she slapped
me, and says she, &#8220;You naughty, naughty
child, haven&#8217;t I forbid you twenty times
over to set foot in that lane? and here you
go dawdling down it at night-time,&#8221; and
so forth, and when she&#8217;d finished I was almost
too much taken aback to say anything:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
but I did make her believe that was the first
I&#8217;d ever heard of it; and that was no more
than the truth. And then, to be sure, she
was sorry she&#8217;d been so short with me, and
to make up she told me the whole story
after my supper. And since then I&#8217;ve often
heard the same from the old people in the
place, and had my own reasons besides for
thinking there was something in it.</p>

<p>Now, up at the far end of that lane&mdash;let
me see, is it on the right- or the left-hand
side as you go up?&mdash;the left-hand side&mdash;you&#8217;ll
find a little patch of bushes and rough
ground in the field, and something like a
broken old hedge round about, and you&#8217;ll
notice there&#8217;s some old gooseberry and currant
bushes growing among it&mdash;or there used
to be, for it&#8217;s years now since I&#8217;ve been up that
way. Well, that means there was a cottage
stood there, of course; and in that cottage,
before I was born or thought of, there lived a
man named Davis. I&#8217;ve heard that he wasn&#8217;t
born in the parish, and it&#8217;s true there&#8217;s nobody
of that name been living about here since
I&#8217;ve known the place. But however that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
may be, this Mr Davis lived very much to
himself and very seldom went to the public-house,
and he didn&#8217;t work for any of the
farmers, having as it seemed enough money
of his own to get along. But he&#8217;d go to
the town on market-days and take up his
letters at the post-house where the mails
called. And one day he came back from
market, and brought a young man with him;
and this young man and he lived together
for some long time, and went about together,
and whether he just did the work of the
house for Mr Davis, or whether Mr Davis
was his teacher in some way, nobody seemed
to know. I&#8217;ve heard he was a pale, ugly
young fellow and hadn&#8217;t much to say for
himself. Well, now, what did those two men
do with themselves? Of course I can&#8217;t tell
you half the foolish things that the people
got into their heads, and we know, don&#8217;t we,
that you mustn&#8217;t speak evil when you aren&#8217;t
sure it&#8217;s true, even when people are dead and
gone. But as I said, those two were always
about together, late and early, up on the
downland and below in the woods; and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
was one walk in particular that they&#8217;d take
regularly once a month, to the place where
you&#8217;ve seen that old figure cut out in the
hillside; and it was noticed that in the
summer-time when they took that walk,
they&#8217;d camp out all night, either there or
somewhere near by. I remember once my
father&mdash;that&#8217;s your great-grandfather&mdash;told
me he had spoken to Mr Davis about it
(for it&#8217;s his land he lived on) and asked him
why he was so fond of going there, but he
only said: &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a wonderful old place, sir,
and I&#8217;ve always been fond of the old-fashioned
things, and when him (that was his man he
meant) and me are together there, it seems
to bring back the old times so plain.&#8221; And
my father said, &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it may suit
<i>you</i>, but <i>I</i> shouldn&#8217;t like a lonely place like
that in the middle of the night.&#8221; And Mr
Davis smiled, and the young man, who&#8217;d
been listening, said, &#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t want for
company at such times,&#8221; and my father said
he couldn&#8217;t help thinking Mr Davis made
some kind of sign, and the young man went
on quick, as if to mend his words, and said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
&#8220;That&#8217;s to say, Mr Davis and me&#8217;s company
enough for each other, ain&#8217;t we, master?
and then there&#8217;s a beautiful air there of a
summer night, and you can see all the
country round under the moon, and it looks
so different, seemingly, to what it do in the
daytime. Why, all them barrows on the
down&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Mr Davis cut in, seeming to be
out of temper with the lad, and said, &#8220;Ah
yes, they&#8217;re old-fashioned places, ain&#8217;t they,
sir? Now, what would you think was the
purpose of them?&#8221; And my father said
(now, dear me, it seems funny doesn&#8217;t it,
that I should recollect all this: but it took
my fancy at the time, and though it&#8217;s dull
perhaps for you, I can&#8217;t help finishing it out
now), well, he said, &#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve heard, Mr
Davis, that they&#8217;re all graves, and I know,
when I&#8217;ve had occasion to plough up one,
there&#8217;s always been some old bones and pots
turned up. But whose graves they are, I
don&#8217;t know: people say the ancient Romans
were all about this country at one time, but
whether they buried their people like that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
can&#8217;t tell.&#8221; And Mr Davis shook his head,
thinking, and said, &#8220;Ah, to be sure: well
they look to me to be older-like than the
ancient Romans, and dressed different&mdash;that&#8217;s
to say, according to the pictures the Romans
was in armour, and you didn&#8217;t never find no
armour, did you, sir, by what you said?&#8221;
And my father was rather surprised and said,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I mentioned anything
about armour, but it&#8217;s true I don&#8217;t remember
to have found any. But you talk as if you&#8217;d
seen &#8217;em, Mr Davis,&#8221; and they both of them
laughed, Mr Davis and the young man, and
Mr Davis said, &#8220;Seen &#8217;em, sir? that would
be a difficult matter after all these years.
Not but what I should like well enough to
know more about them old times and people,
and what they worshipped and all.&#8221; And my
father said, &#8220;Worshipped? Well, I dare say
they worshipped the old man on the hill.&#8221;
&#8220;Ah, indeed!&#8221; Mr Davis said, &#8220;well, I
shouldn&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; and my father went on
and told them what he&#8217;d heard and read
about the heathens and their sacrifices: what
you&#8217;ll learn some day for yourself, Charles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
when you go to school and begin your Latin.
And they seemed to be very much interested,
both of them; but my father said he
couldn&#8217;t help thinking the most of what he
was saying was no news to them. That was
the only time he ever had much talk with
Mr Davis, and it stuck in his mind, particularly,
he said, the young man&#8217;s word about
<i>not wanting for company</i>: because in those
days there was a lot of talk in the villages
round about&mdash;why, but for my father interfering,
the people here would have ducked
an old lady for a witch.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i>: What does that mean, granny,
ducked an old lady for a witch? Are there
witches here now?</p>

<p><i>Grandmother</i>: No, no, dear! why, what ever
made me stray off like that? No, no,
that&#8217;s quite another affair. What I was
going to say was that the people in other
places round about believed that some sort
of meetings went on at night-time on that
hill where the man is, and that those who
went there were up to no good. But don&#8217;t
you interrupt me now, for it&#8217;s getting late.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Well, I suppose it was a matter of three
years that Mr Davis and this young man
went on living together: and then all of a
sudden, a dreadful thing happened. I don&#8217;t
know if I ought to tell you. (<i>Outcries of</i>
&#8220;Oh yes! yes, granny, you must,&#8221; etc.),
Well, then, you must promise not to get
frightened and go screaming out in the
middle of the night. (&#8220;No, no, we won&#8217;t,
of course not!&#8221;) One morning very early
towards the turn of the year, I think it was
in September, one of the woodmen had to
go up to his work at the top of the long
covert just as it was getting light; and just
where there were some few big oaks in a
sort of clearing deep in the wood he saw at
a distance a white thing that looked like a
man through the mist, and he was in two
minds about going on, but go on he did,
and made out as he came near that it <i>was</i> a
man, and more than that, it was Mr Davis&#8217;s
young man: dressed in a sort of white gown
he was, and hanging by his neck to the limb
of the biggest oak, quite, quite dead: and
near his feet there lay on the ground a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
hatchet all in a gore of blood. Well, what
a terrible sight that was for anyone to come
upon in that lonely place! This poor man
was nearly out of his wits: he dropped
everything he was carrying and ran as hard
as ever he could straight down to the
Parsonage, and woke them up and told what
he&#8217;d seen. And old Mr White, who was
the parson then, sent him off to get two or
three of the best men, the blacksmith and
the churchwardens and what not, while he
dressed himself, and all of them went up to
this dreadful place with a horse to lay the
poor body on and take it to the house.
When they got there, everything was just
as the woodman had said: but it was a
terrible shock to them all to see how the
corpse was dressed, specially to old Mr
White, for it seemed to him to be like a
mockery of the church surplice that was on
it, only, he told my father, not the same
in the fashion of it. And when they came
to take down the body from the oak-tree
they found there was a chain of some metal
round the neck and a little ornament like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
wheel hanging to it on the front, and it was
very old looking, they said. Now in the
meantime they had sent off a boy to run to
Mr Davis&#8217;s house and see whether he was
at home; for of course they couldn&#8217;t but
have their suspicions. And Mr White said
they must send too to the constable of the
next parish, and get a message to another
magistrate (he was a magistrate himself),
and so there was running hither and thither.
But my father as it happened was away from
home that night, otherwise they would have
fetched him first. So then they laid the
body across the horse, and they say it was
all they could manage to keep the beast
from bolting away from the time they were
in sight of the tree, for it seemed to be
mad with fright. However, they managed
to bind the eyes and lead it down through
the wood and back into the village street;
and there, just by the big tree where the
stocks are, they found a lot of the women
gathered together, and this boy whom they&#8217;d
sent to Mr Davis&#8217;s house lying in the middle,
as white as paper, and not a word could they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
get out of him, good or bad. So they saw
there was something worse yet to come, and
they made the best of their way up the lane
to Mr Davis&#8217;s house. And when they got
near that, the horse they were leading
seemed to go mad again with fear, and
reared up and screamed, and struck out
with its forefeet and the man that was
leading it was as near as possible being
killed, and the dead body fell off its back.
So Mr White bid them get the horse away
as quick as might be, and they carried the
body straight into the living-room, for the
door stood open. And then they saw what
it was that had given the poor boy such a
fright, and they guessed why the horse went
mad, for you know horses can&#8217;t bear the
smell of dead blood.</p>

<p>There was a long table in the room, more
than the length of a man, and on it there
lay the body of Mr Davis. The eyes were
bound over with a linen band and the arms
were tied across the back, and the feet were
bound together with another band. But
the fearful thing was that the breast being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
quite bare, the bone of it was split through
from the top downwards with an axe! Oh,
it was a terrible sight; not one there but
turned faint and ill with it, and had to go
out into the fresh air. Even Mr White,
who was what you might call a hard
nature of a man, was quite overcome and
said a prayer for strength in the garden.</p>

<p>At last they laid out the other body as best
they could in the room, and searched about
to see if they could find out how such a
frightful thing had come to pass. And in
the cupboards they found a quantity of
herbs and jars with liquors, and it came
out, when people that understood such
matters had looked into it, that some of
these liquors were drinks to put a person
asleep. And they had little doubt that
that wicked young man had put some of
this into Mr Davis&#8217;s drink, and then used
him as he did, and, after that, the sense of
his sin had come upon him and he had cast
himself away.</p>

<p>Well now, you couldn&#8217;t understand all
the law business that had to be done by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
coroner and the magistrates; but there was
a great coming and going of people over it
for the next day or two, and then the people
of the parish got together and agreed that
they couldn&#8217;t bear the thought of these two
being buried in the churchyard alongside of
Christian people; for I must tell you there
were papers and writings found in the
drawers and cupboards that Mr White and
some other clergymen looked into; and
they put their names to a paper that said
these men were guilty, by their own allowing,
of the dreadful sin of idolatry; and they
feared there were some in the neighbouring
places that were not free from that wickedness,
and called upon them to repent, lest
the same fearful thing that was come to these
men should befall them also; and then they
burnt those writings. So then, Mr White
was of the same mind as the parishioners,
and late one evening twelve men that were
chosen went with him to that evil house,
and with them they took two biers made
very roughly for the purpose and two pieces
of black cloth, and down at the cross-road,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
where you take the turn for Bascombe and
Wilcombe, there were other men waiting
with torches, and a pit dug, and a great
crowd of people gathered together from all
round about. And the men that went to
the cottage went in with their hats on their
heads, and four of them took the two bodies
and laid them on the biers and covered them
over with the black cloths, and no one said
a word, but they bore them down the lane,
and they were cast into the pit and covered
over with stones and earth, and then Mr
White spoke to the people that were
gathered together. My father was there,
for he had come back when he heard the
news, and he said he never should forget
the strangeness of the sight, with the torches
burning and those two black things huddled
together in the pit, and not a sound from
any of the people, except it might be a child
or a woman whimpering with the fright.
And so, when Mr White had finished speaking,
they all turned away and left them
lying there.</p>

<p>They say horses don&#8217;t like the spot even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
now, and I&#8217;ve heard there was something of
a mist or a light hung about for a long time
after, but I don&#8217;t know the truth of that.
But this I do know, that next day my
father&#8217;s business took him past the opening
of the lane, and he saw three or four little
knots of people standing at different places
along it, seemingly in a state of mind about
something; and he rode up to them, and
asked what was the matter. And they ran
up to him and said, &#8220;Oh, Squire, it&#8217;s the
blood! Look at the blood!&#8221; and kept on
like that. So he got off his horse and
they showed him, and there, in four places,
I think it was, he saw great patches in
the road, of blood: but he could hardly
see it was blood, for almost every spot
of it was covered with great black flies,
that never changed their place or moved.
And that blood was what had fallen out
of Mr Davis&#8217;s body as they bore it down
the lane. Well, my father couldn&#8217;t bear
to do more than just take in the nasty sight
so as to be sure of it, and then he said
to one of those men that was there, &#8220;Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
you make haste and fetch a basket or a
barrow full of clean earth out of the churchyard
and spread it over these places, and
I&#8217;ll wait here till you come back.&#8221; And
very soon he came back, and the old man
that was sexton with him, with a shovel
and the earth in a hand-barrow: and they
set it down at the first of the places and made
ready to cast the earth upon it; and as soon
as ever they did that, what do you think?
the flies that were on it rose up in the air in
a kind of a solid cloud and moved off up the
lane towards the house, and the sexton (he
was parish clerk as well) stopped and looked
at them and said to my father, &#8220;Lord of
flies, sir,&#8221; and no more would he say. And
just the same it was at the other places,
every one of them.</p>

<p><i>Charles</i>: But what did he mean, granny?</p>

<p><i>Grandmother</i>: Well, dear, you remember
to ask Mr Lucas when you go to him for
your lesson to-morrow. I can&#8217;t stop now
to talk about it: it&#8217;s long past bed-time for
you already. The next thing was, my father
made up his mind no one was going to live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
in that cottage again, or yet use any of the
things that were in it: so, though it was one
of the best in the place, he sent round word
to the people that it was to be done away
with, and anyone that wished could bring
a faggot to the burning of it; and that&#8217;s
what was done. They built a pile of wood
in the living-room and loosened the thatch
so as the fire could take good hold, and then
set it alight; and as there was no brick, only
the chimney-stack and the oven, it wasn&#8217;t
long before it was all gone. I seem to
remember seeing the chimney when I was
a little girl, but that fell down of itself at
last.</p>

<p>Now this that I&#8217;ve got to is the last bit of
all. You may be sure that for a long time
the people said Mr Davis and that young
man were seen about, the one of them in the
wood and both of them where the house had
been, or passing together down the lane,
particularly in the spring of the year and at
autumn-time. I can&#8217;t speak to that, though
if we were sure there are such things as
ghosts, it would seem likely that people like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
that wouldn&#8217;t rest quiet. But I can tell
you this, that one evening in the month of
March, just before your grandfather and I
were married, we&#8217;d been taking a long walk
in the woods together and picking flowers
and talking as young people will that are
courting; and so much taken up with each
other that we never took any particular notice
where we were going. And on a sudden I
cried out, and your grandfather asked what
was the matter. The matter was that I&#8217;d
felt a sharp prick on the back of my hand,
and I snatched it to me and saw a black
thing on it, and struck it with the other
hand and killed it. And I showed it him,
and he was a man who took notice of all
such things, and he said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve never
seen ought like that fly before,&#8221; and though
to my own eye it didn&#8217;t seem very much out
of the common, I&#8217;ve no doubt he was right.</p>

<p>And then we looked about us and lo and
behold if we weren&#8217;t in the very lane, just
in front of the place where that house had
stood, and, as they told me after, just where
the men set down the biers a minute when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
they bore them out of the garden gate.
You may be sure we made haste away from
there; at least, I made your grandfather
come away quick, for I was wholly upset
at finding myself there; but he would have
lingered about out of curiosity if I&#8217;d have
let him. Whether there was anything
about there more than we could see I shall
never be sure: perhaps it was partly the
venom of that horrid fly&#8217;s bite that was
working in me that made me feel so
strange; for, dear me, how that poor arm
and hand of mine did swell up, to be sure!
I&#8217;m afraid to tell you how large it was
round! and the pain of it, too! Nothing
my mother could put on it had any power
over it at all, and it wasn&#8217;t till she was persuaded
by our old nurse to get the wise man
over at Bascombe to come and look at it,
that I got any peace at all. But he seemed
to know all about it, and said I wasn&#8217;t the
first that had been taken that way. &#8220;When
the sun&#8217;s gathering his strength,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and when he&#8217;s in the height of it, and
when he&#8217;s beginning to lose his hold, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
when he&#8217;s in his weakness, them that haunts
about that lane had best to take heed to
themselves.&#8221; But what it was he bound
on my arm and what he said over it, he
wouldn&#8217;t tell us. After that I soon got
well again, but since then I&#8217;ve heard often
enough of people suffering much the same
as I did; only of late years it doesn&#8217;t seem
to happen but very seldom: and maybe
things like that do die out in the course of
time.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s the reason, Charles, why I say
to you that I won&#8217;t have you gathering me
blackberries, no, nor eating them either, in
that lane; and now you know all about
it, I don&#8217;t fancy you&#8217;ll want to yourself.
There! Off to bed you go this minute.
What&#8217;s that, Lucy? A light in your room?
The idea of such a thing! You get yourself
undressed at once and say your prayers, and
perhaps if your father doesn&#8217;t want me when
he wakes up, I&#8217;ll come and say good-night
to you. And you, Charles, if I hear anything
of you frightening your little sister
on the way up to your bed, I shall tell your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
father that very moment, and you know
what happened to you the last time.</p>

<p>The door closes, and granny, after listening
intently for a minute or two, resumes her
knitting. The Squire still slumbers.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
